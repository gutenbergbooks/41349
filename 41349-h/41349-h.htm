<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">I</span>N presenting to the reading public this
fourth volume in the series of <i>Historic
Towns</i>, a volume which brings the series to a
close, it is in order for the editor to call attention
to the necessarily large measure of liberty
accorded to the contributors in their treatment
of the records of the several towns. With
several of his co-laborers the editor has on one
point or another found himself at variance.
Examples of such difference of conclusions are
presented in the references to the Mormons
and to the Mound-builders.</p>

<p>The editor bears in mind, however, the
essential difference between editorial responsibilities
and those belonging to the writers of
the papers. It was his duty to choose as contributors
not writers who necessarily share his
own view, but those who are most fairly representative
of the towns described, who possess
the necessary familiarity with the historic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
records, and whose narratives would be assured
of an appreciative and sympathetic reception
from their fellow-townsmen,&mdash;men who
love their town</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"with love far-brought</span>
<span class="ni">From out the storied Past, and used</span>
<span class="ni">Within the Present."</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the studies of Western history made by
the editor during the past ten years, two historians
have been his inspiration: Francis
Parkman, of blessed memory, revered by all
who love good literature and good history;
and Theodore Roosevelt, now by the will of
God President of the United States, and a
trustworthy and inspiring writer of our nation's
history long before he took his place among
its distinguished makers.</p>

<p>In offering to the public this final volume of
<i>American Historic Towns</i>, the editor ventures
to hope that by thus focalizing and
localizing Western history, the publishers,
authors, and editor are contributing somewhat
to the popular knowledge of and interest in
the history of the Great West which Parkman
and Roosevelt first made possible.</p>

<p>Since with this volume the series is brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
to a close, the editor trusts that the publishers,
Messrs. G.P. Putnam's Sons, will lay aside
their reluctance to be mentioned in the Preface,
and will permit the editor to express his
admiration and indebtedness for their share,
larger than is usual with publishers, in the
production of the series. To his wife, Gertrude
Wilson Powell, acknowledgment is also
due for aid given in this as in the earlier volumes,
the full value of which cannot here be
indicated. Besides making two important contributions
to the volume, Messrs. R.G.
Thwaites and Harold Bolce have ever been
ready with suggestion and counsel, always
valued and almost always followed. To Doctors
Talcott Williams, Albert Shaw, and
George Petrie, the editor would speak this
last word of gratitude for cordial and skilled
assistance in connection not alone with this
book but with the whole undertaking. This
closing volume now goes out, with the editor's
best-wishes, to the earlier friends of the
series and to the new friends yet to be gained
for it.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="chapby">By REUBEN G. THWAITES</p>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">T</span>HE first two volumes of this series&mdash;those
devoted to the historic towns of New
England and the Middle States&mdash;dealt with
communities each group of which has had for
the most part a common origin, has progressed
along practically parallel lines, and possesses
characteristics closely akin. The volume upon
the towns of the South brought closely to
view the cosmopolitan character of the population
which has settled our continent to the
South and Southwest of the Appalachian wall.
The stories of Baltimore, Washington, Richmond,
Charleston, Savannah, and St. Augustine
bring into view widely-different origins,
experiences, and interests along a single
stretch of coast; while Mobile and New Orleans,
Knoxville, Nashville, and Louisville,
Vicksburg and Little Rock, are groups representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
chapters in our history which appear
to have but slight connection save in the view
of those who have closely studied the mainsprings
of American development.</p>

<p>The present volume represents even a wider
range of historical interest. The attentive
reader will, however, discover that although
these towns of the far-stretching trans-Alleghany
region have sprung from curiously
divergent beginnings, and are apparently incongruous
in composition and in aims, there really
is and has been much in common among them.</p>

<p>In order to understand Western history, one
must first have knowledge of the details of
the titanic struggle for settlement in North
America, made respectively by Spain, France,
and England. The early decline of Spanish
power north of the Red and the Arkansas,
save for the later temporary holding of Louisiana;
the protracted tragedy which ended on
the Plains of Abraham in the Fall of New
France; the Revolution of the English colonists,
and its portentous results; the Louisiana
Purchase of 1803; the Mexican War, the
episode of California, the story of Texas, with
their consequent ousting of Spain from lands
north of the Rio Grande and the Gila&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
these are factors bearing the closest relation
to the history of the West, and consequently
of many of the historic towns whose stories
have been grouped within these covers.</p>

<p>With these episodes of national rivalry, and
consequent diplomacy and war, were intimately
concerned the French fur-trade outposts
of Detroit, Mackinac, Vincennes, and St.
Louis, links in the forted chain which bound
Canada and Louisiana, and by means of which
it was sought to form a barrier against the
Westward growth of the English colonies;
also the Spanish stations of San Francisco,
Monterey, Los Angeles, and Santa Fé, which
were at once political vantage points and mission
seats, for the spread of Spanish power
and civilization from Mexico, among the brown
barbarians of the North. St. Louis experienced
both French and Spanish régimes, while
Mackinac, Detroit, and Vincennes were much
affected by the period of English occupancy.</p>

<p>As settlement grew upon the Atlantic coast,
the English frontier was inevitably pushed
farther and farther from tidewater. The
hunter followed his game westward; so the
forest trader, seeking the ever-receding camps
of the aborigines, and, in due course, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
raiser of cattle, horses, and swine who needed
fresh pastures for his herds as tillage steadily
encroached upon the wild lands of the border.
At first timorously occupying the valleys and
foothills of the eastern slopes, hunter, trader,
and grazier, each in his turn, cautiously followed
buffalo traces and Indian war-paths over
the crest of the great range, and hailed with
glee waters descending into the mysterious
West. Not less formidable than the barriers
reared by nature were those interposed by the
savage, who with dismay saw his hunting
grounds fast dwindling under the sway of the
land-grabbing English; and by the jealous
machinations of the military agents and fur
traders of New France, who brooked no
rivalry in their commercial exploitation of the
forest.</p>

<p>When New France fell, the English crown
strictly forbade further settlement in the back
country. This order was issued upon the representations
of London merchants interested,
as had been the merchant adventurers of
France, in preserving the forest for the Indians
and the fur trade; the ministry were not unmindful
also that the bold and liberty-loving
frontiersmen who crossed the mountains might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
come to consider English political control as
unessential to their being.</p>

<p>This policy was, however, diametrically opposed
to the policy of the border. The fertile
fields of the West were far from the observation
of London officials, the spirit of unrest
and the desire for gain laughed at royal proclamations,
and the trans-Alleghany movement
but gathered force. By the opening of the
Revolution, Kentucky and Tennessee were
practically staked out; by its close, Americans
were sole white masters of the West to the
east of the Mississippi, save for a brief holding
by the British of Detroit, Mackinac, and
other upper lake posts, as security for treaty
obligations as yet unfulfilled.</p>

<p>It had been the custom of England to grant
lands for military service; the American colonies
had likewise liberally rewarded their defenders
in the Indian wars; Revolutionary
soldiers were now given free access to the broad
acres of the West, the direct result of this policy
being the settlements of Marietta and Cleveland.</p>

<p>Water courses have ever been of the highest
importance in determining the lines of
continental settlement. The river St. Lawrence
and the great lakes offered to the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
of New France a continual invitation to explore
the regions whence they flowed. It was
not long before the French found that the
sources of south-and west-flowing waters were
not far from the banks of the eastering waterways
upon which they dwelt. By ascending
short tributaries, and carrying their light craft
along practicable paths, or portages, first used
by the Indians, they could re-launch into
strange and devious paths which led to all
parts of the continental interior&mdash;the Ohio,
the Mississippi, the Assiniboine, and their
multifarious affluents and connections. Thus
easily did New France spread along the St.
Lawrence and the lakes, over into the Ohio
and the Mississippi, and down their gliding
channels to New Orleans and the sea.</p>

<p>In crossing the Alleghanies, the English
sought the Ohio and its tributaries&mdash;the Alleghany,
the Monongahela, the Cumberland,
the Tennessee, the Kanawha, the Big Sandy.
The Ohio was long the chief gateway to the
West. Upon this royal path into the wilderness,
the Ohio Company sent Christopher
Gist to prospect and report; for its possession,
France and England came to final
blows through the action at Fort Necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
of Major Washington, than whom no man
knew the Ohio better; it was an approach to
Kentucky more inviting than Boone's Wilderness
Road, through Cumberland Gap; Clark's
flotilla came swooping down the great river to
conquer Kaskaskia and Vincennes; and, the
Revolution ended, Rufus Putnam and his
fellow veterans from New England claimed
their military land grants along this continental
highway, at Marietta. Cincinnati, also,
was an outpost deliberately planted upon the
great pathway to the West, although otherwise
differing in genesis. It was by the Great
Lakes, that other principal approach to the
West, that Moses Cleaveland founded the settlement
of Revolutionary soldiers who were
redeeming their land warrants in New Connecticut,
or the Western Reserve&mdash;an incident
closely connecting Ohio with colonial history.</p>

<p>Early in the Western experiences of the
new nation, came Indian wars. These resulted
in treaties where under the defeated tribesmen
were either forbidden to enter defined areas
of settlement, or were confined within specific
reservations. This necessitated the construction
of rude but effective frontier forts, which
not infrequently proved the nuclei of hamlets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
that grew into considerable towns. Sometimes
these forts were essential to the direct protection
of the white settlers, who, upon occasion
of alarm, flew to cover within the log palisades,
which were stout enough to resist a barbaric
foe unpossessed of artillery; such was Fort
Washington, which in time became Cincinnati.</p>

<p>The forest trade was long the chief and only
commercial interest in the West, and at certain
points garrisoned forts were necessary to serve
the traders as depôts and as havens of refuge;
this was the part played by Detroit, Mackinac,
Chicago, St. Paul, Vincennes, and St. Louis.
In the case of Des Moines, the fort was established
for the protection of a group of reservation
Indians who might otherwise have fallen
victims to a superior savage foe.</p>

<p>Agricultural settlers rapidly took up lands.
Battle against it as he would,&mdash;and the early
history of the border is a piteous tale of man's
inhumanity to man,&mdash;the dispossessed savage
found this army of occupation impregnable.
As the frontier moved to the westward of the
Mississippi, it was accompanied by the Indians
and the fur trade. Territories were erected
by Congress out of the lands of the ousted
Iroquois and Algonkins, and these political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
divisions were soon admitted to the Union
as states; mines were exploited, forests were
depleted, miscellaneous industries were created,
and these new interests not only profoundly
affected the old towns, but gave rise
to a new order of cities.</p>

<p>Indianapolis and Madison are examples of
town sites staked out in virgin forests by ambitious
and imaginative speculators, and, before
a house could be built, set aside by statute
as capitals of their respective young commonwealths.
It is not always that towns thus
artificially planted have similarly thriven. Under
normal conditions, a successful city is as
much a matter of natural growth as a tree,
whose germ has chanced to fall in favored soil.
Many, perhaps most, Western towns of importance,
that were planted before the days of the
railroad, when waterways were highways, are
upon the sites of early villages of aborigines,
who made their stands at natural vantage
points&mdash;at a river mouth, convenient for transportation,
or close to considerable fishing
grounds; at a waterfall, because here fish are
plenty, and canoes must be carried around the
obstruction, so that the villagers are masters
of the highway; upon a portage path, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
of ease in reaching and controlling divergent
water systems; upon a bluff overlooking
waterways, for facility of observation and control;
upon a fertile river bottom, because of
good corn lands. In due time, whites came
to such a centre of population and established
a trading post; here and there, as at Detroit,
Chicago, St. Louis, Vincennes, and Kansas
City (Westport), the post in due time developed
into a garrisoned fort; and the surrounding
community, at first dependent on the
fur trade or the military, under modern conditions
became a town of importance. Scores,
possibly hundreds, of such examples might be
cited; and even when some thrifty towns of
the West appear at first sight to have no connection
with such a past, antiquarians have not
infrequently discovered evidences that substantially
the same reasons which before the
railway era had led civilized men to select the
site, caused its previous occupancy by aborigines&mdash;sometimes
at so early a day that the
only remaining relics are the curious earthworks
which the progenitors of our Western
Indians, prompted by religious fervor, constructed
anywhere from two and a half to ten
centuries ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
Minneapolis and Spokane, both of them old
Indian sites, are the direct outgrowth of the
superb waterpowers which have given them
pre-eminence in the industrial world.</p>

<p>We have seen that the Great Lakes and the
great rivers were the paths to the Mississippi
basin in the days of the canoe, the bateau,
and the pack-horse. The early movement of
population over the trans-Mississippi plains
and through the passes of the Rockies was
by means of wagons along well-worn buffalo
traces, which Indians had followed in the pursuit
of game. Where rivers intersected these
overland trails, ferries were instituted, their
keepers doing a thriving business in helping
upon their way fur traders, explorers, miners,
and settlers. Such was the origin of Kansas
City and Omaha, which naturally developed,
with the rush of immigration, into great centres
of distribution. In every quarter of our land,
from the earliest colonial days, the frontier
ferryman, with his tavern and trading house,
has been a town builder.</p>

<p>The discovery of precious metals in the hills
of Colorado gave life to the mining camp of
Denver, which in time became the metropolis
of a wide district, to which irrigation brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
a wealth more enduring than gold and
silver.</p>

<p>Portland, San Francisco, and Los Angeles
are the open doors of the Pacific Coast, and
their growth is thus easily accounted for.
Prophecies are current of the possible commercial
supremacy of these Pacific-coast towns,
as a consequence of our new interests in the
Far East. It is curious, in this connection, to
remember that Spain's motive in founding her
California colonies, four generations ago, was,
on the temporal side, the more strongly to
establish herself in the Philippines.</p>

<p>Strangest of all stories is that of Salt Lake
City, the product of religious zeal seeking a
supposedly inaccessible desert as a haven from
persecution. Finally, when the laborious development
of the wilderness has brought rich
fruitage, this hermit city finds itself a station
on one of the world's most-traveled highways.</p>

<p>The coming of the railway, and the consequent
practical abandonment of the waterway,
wrought a profound change in the fortunes of
the Western towns. The railway paid small
heed to watercourses, save in mountainous
country; it struck out upon short-cuts over the
plains and prairies, almost regardless of topog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>raphy.
Hundreds of staid and promising river
and lake towns received a staggering blow
when, for various reasons,&mdash;sometimes their
own failure to encourage the enterprise,&mdash;the
railway passed them by and entered rival and
often less pretentious communities, which now
were quickened into new vigor. A more favorable
situation for a bridge across the stream
was often the determining factor which caused
several towns upon a river to die and the fortunate
one to be transformed into a metropolis.
The arbitrary erection throughout the West of
new paths of commerce, of new centres of distribution,
during the decade and a half before
the War of Secession, was of itself a revolutionary
element in urban history.</p>

<p>Almost as profound in its effects was the
practically contemporaneous dispersion through
this vast territory of millions of European immigrants,
who came to open farms, to practise
trades, and in city and in village to carry forward,
often to inaugurate, hundreds of new commercial
and industrial enterprises. The new-comers
brought strange habits of thought and
social customs; some of the most desirable of
these they engrafted upon their American
neighbors, while at the same time they them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>selves
were being consciously or unconsciously
remoulded into American citizens&mdash;who, whatever
may be said, will always be essentially but
transplanted Englishmen modified by environment
and political education.</p>

<p>Of the many nationalities of the European
continent which have planted stakes in North
America, the Germans and the Scandinavians,
closely allied to our Anglo-Saxon stock, have
been the most numerous and have exercised
the greatest influence. Many considerable
towns, like Cincinnati, Detroit, St. Louis, and
Omaha, have become strongly German, with
not a few of the characteristics of old Germany,
such as are evinced in a general fostering of
music and rational outdoor recreation. The
Scandinavian element vies good-naturedly with
the German, as at Madison and Chicago;
while Minneapolis may be considered as the
centre of Scandinavian influence, fostering
sturdy democracy and tenacious enterprise.</p>

<p>In the large towns which have their roots
planted in New France, the French element is
no longer of considerable importance. The
French borderer was a vivacious, fun-loving,
easy-going fellow, and upon the road to modern
opulence and power has long since been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
passed; to-day, as an urban dweller, he is not
seriously reckoned with by the politician, and
this is a safe guide to the relative standing of
a race in any American city. The towns
which we have more recently inherited from
Spain still possess, in their older quarters,
strong characteristics to link them with the
past. Here and there, as with the French,
individual Spaniards or mixed-bloods rise into
prominence in our modern life&mdash;but only
through the channel of Americanization, which
means effacement of the old régime. Spanish
traits have left permanent traces on the Southwest
and the Pacific, as some French traits
are a part of the lasting heritage of the Old
Northwest; but Spaniards and Frenchmen as
such are rapidly fading from our historic towns.</p>

<p>A half-century ago, few of the twenty-one
Western towns whose stories are herein collected
had taken upon themselves the characteristics
which to-day chiefly distinguish them.
We have seen that the advent of the railway
was for many the starting-point upon the road
to prosperity; the arrival of European immigrants,
with traditions of toil and thrift, proved
the turning stage for others, and strengthened
all. The War of Secession shook the Republic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
to its foundations; but from it the North
rose with fresh vigor, and rapidly developed
in growth and ambition, with the ensuing
commercial and industrial conditions which we
encounter to-day. Nowhere has this development
been quite so noticeable as in the towns
of the West.</p>

<p>Pioneer men and women are necessarily too
closely engaged in taming the wilderness to
have either thought or leisure for any but the
most elementary education. But now that the
West is no longer the frontier, and mines, forests,
fisheries, manufactures, and scientific agriculture
have brought wealth and comparative
leisure, there is among her people no lack of
aspiration for culture. In no section of the
United States are study clubs relatively more
numerous, in town and country; university
extension courses and the lyceum prosper
everywhere; the common-school systems,
capped by the fast-growing State universities
with their thousands of students, are exhibiting
a healthy growth along the most approved
lines under the guidance of teachers of national
reputation; excellent private academies
and colleges are numerous in every commonwealth.
Several of the towns mentioned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
this volume have won wide reputation as educational
centres&mdash;notably Cleveland, Chicago,
Madison, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and San
Francisco.</p>

<p>From these Western towns there issues no
note of decadence. Theirs is the glowing
ambition of youth. Each of our several authors
is quite confident, and properly so, that
his town is the handsomest, brightest, and
most prosperous of all; or, if it is not, that it
is soon to be. Its commerce ever widens, its
industries expand in capacity and number, its
railways connect it each year with some new
sphere of trade; and, what is better, it is
making strides, in breezy Western fashion, in
the cultivation of the higher things of life, in
its churches, its schools, its libraries and museums,
its charities, its parks, its popular conveniences,
its insistence upon moral and
material municipal cleanliness. It is pleasant
and profitable to trace the careers of communities
such as this; to note, for instance, by
what means the Indian village became a trading
post, then a fort, next a hamlet, and at
last comes to be pulsating with the ambitions
and struggling with the multifarious problems
of a great modern city. Herein is a record of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
urban development crowded into the span of
a single human life, that in the Old World it
took centuries to accomplish.</p>

<p>It is often flippantly asserted that America
has no history; and even well-informed Americans,
who have come to appreciate their national
history at large, are apt to fancy that,
in any event, the West has had a prosaic
career, being simply an overflow or outgrowth
from the East. But a perusal of these pages
will surely convince the thoughtful reader that
Western history is not so easily disposed of.
It will be found a chronicle abounding in complexities,
aglow with life and color, freighted
with significance to the continent at large.
The chief towns of this historic West have
come down to us from many sorts of beginnings,
have traveled by differing and devious
paths, often encountering curious adventures
by the way, until, quickened by modern resources
and demands, they have each in its
kind come creditably to serve mankind in
some useful way.</p>

<h2>MARIETTA<br />

THE PLYMOUTH OF THE WEST</h2>

<p class="chapby">By MURIEL CAMPBELL DYAR</p>

<blockquote><p>"The paths from the heights of Abraham led to Independence
Hall, Independence Hall led finally to Yorktown, and Yorktown
guided the footsteps of your Fathers to Marietta."<i>&mdash;Daniels</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">A</span>T the point where the Muskingum empties
into the Ohio, the River Beautiful, across
whose waters the Ohio hills look tenderly away
into the distances of West Virginia, there was
sown, in 1788, the tiny seed for the development
of the Northwest Territory. Here, on
the memorable seventh of April, landed forty-eight
New England pioneers; here stayed the
keel of the second <i>Mayflower</i>, bearing as her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
burden not only the men whose names have
become immortal in American history, but,
more than these, the Ordinance of 1787 with its
momentous articles of compact&mdash;an ordinance
ranking "next to the Declaration of Independence
in the establishment of Constitutional
liberty in the United States." Here was
founded that other Plymouth, Marietta, the
brave little gateway through which the nation's
civilization journeyed onward from the Atlantic
seaboard to the fallow empires of the West.</p>

<p>No seer was needed to foreshadow the success
the Marietta colony was to have. Two
years before its coming, the character of the
colony was presaged when there met in Boston,
at the Bunch of Grapes Tavern, whose
gilded sign creaked temptingly in her high salt
winds, a convention called by General Rufus
Putnam and General Benjamin Tupper for the
formation of the Ohio Company, with the purpose
of founding a new State in the territory
northwest of the Ohio River. The Company
was composed of high-minded men, largely
officers in the late war. In their petition to
Congress for the purchase of western land
they stipulated, for its organization, law and
order, provision for education and for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
maintenance of religion and the total exclusion
of slavery. For these compacts, some of the
greatest statesmen in the young Republic
brought to bear the power of their genius; for
these, the quiet Ipswich clergyman, Manasseh
Cutler, as agent of the Ohio Company, pleaded
with matchless eloquence in Congress; for
these, Rufus Putnam, the "Father and Founder
of Ohio," gave the largess of his ability and
rugged force.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_045.jpg">MARIETTA.</a><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></div>

<blockquote><p>"An interlude in Congress," says Mr. Bancroft, "was
shaping the character and destiny of the United States
of America. Sublime and humane and eventful as was
the result, it will not take many words to show how it
was brought about. For a time wisdom and peace and
justice dwelt among men, and the great Ordinance which
alone could give continuance to the Union came in serenity
and stillness. Every man that had a share in it
seemed to be moved by an Invisible Hand to do just
what was wanted of him; all that was wrongfully undertaken
fell by the wayside; whatever was needed for the
happy completion of the work arrived opportunely and
at the right moment moved into its place."</p></blockquote>

<p>To the forty-eight men sent into the wilderness
by the Ohio Company history gives a
generous and well-merited praise. They were
of the same race and of the same upright faith
as the brave Englishmen who in 1620 landed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
on the bleak, gray rock of Plymouth. All
that was true and forceful in the Plymouth
faith was theirs; they had the same love of
law and religion, the same genius for order and
a firm self-government, the same courage of
conviction, the same independence of thought
and action. They possessed, too, much of
that ancient war-ready temper which had shorn
the English King of his divine right and had
created for the English people the House of
Commons. Their heroism had adorned every
battlefield of the Revolution; their roll included
generals, majors, colonels and captains.</p>

<blockquote><p>"No colony in America," said Washington, with that
cautious, unerring judgment of his, "was ever settled
under such favorable auspices as that about to commence
at the Muskingum. Information, property and strength
will be its characteristics. I know many of the settlers
personally, and there never were men better calculated
to promote the welfare of such a community."</p></blockquote>

<p>"I know them all," cried the Marquis de La
Fayette, his fine French voice trembling with
emotion when the list of their names was read
to him on his visit to Marietta. "I knew them
at Brandywine, Yorktown and Rhode Island.
They were the bravest of the brave." General
Putnam himself was at their head, the "impress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of whose character is strongly marked on the
population of Marietta in their business, institutions
and manners." Here were Samuel
H. Parsons, the distinguished general, the able
writer, the accomplished jurist; James M. Varnum,
the brilliant scholar, the gallant officer;
Abraham Whipple, the brave commodore, to
whom belongs the glory of firing the first
naval gun in the cause of American independence,
an act that gave birth to the American
navy. Here were Winthrop Sargent, the
Secretary of the Territory, Benjamin Tupper,
the hero of many battles and the devoted
friend of Putnam in the forming of the Ohio
Company; Return Jonathan Meigs, afterwards
Governor of Ohio. Here were Nye,
Buell, Cutler, Fearing, Foster, Sproat, Cushing,
Goodale, Dana, True, Devol and others
no less worthy and distinguished, whose names
are the richest heritage of their descendants.</p>

<span class="caption">GENERAL RUFUS PUTMAN</span>
</div>

<p>The story of the coming of the pioneers is a
twice-told tale to the student of our nation's
history. In the disheartening gray dawn of a
December morning, 1787, the first little band
paraded before Manasseh Cutler's own church
at Ipswich, and, after the firing of a salute,
started "for the Ohio country," as their lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>ing
wagon proclaimed. Another joined this at
Danvers, and yet another, pushing on from
famous old Rutland, started from Hartford,
Ct., led by the beloved and always inspiring
General Putnam.
The toilsome
journey
overland, along
an old Indian
trail through
Connecticut and
Pennsylvania, at
that season of
the year white
with winter, ended
at last at the
Ohio River.
Here, at Sumrill's
ferry, out of
timber that still
sang of the forests,
was built
the <i>Mayflower</i>, her bows raking like a galley,
her burthen fifty tons&mdash;a humble enough namesake
of the famous Pilgrim vessel. As the pioneers
went onward down the river, the snow,
which at first lay heavy in the hollows of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
hills, melted into thin patches here and there,
until, when they reached Fort Harmar, at the
fair mouth of the Muskingum, April bourgeoned
into unexpected beauty about them.
It was a golden augury for the little town, to
which its soldier founders gave the name of
Marietta, in grateful remembrance of the sympathy
of Marie Antoinette for the colonies
during the weary period of their Revolution, a
name which still keeps her citizens lovers of
that ill-fated Queen of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_051.jpg">OLD BLOCKHOUSE, MARIETTA.</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span></div>

<p>Enthusiastic news of the first summer of the
colony went back over the mountains to Ipswich
and Rutland. "The climate is exceeding
healthy," blithely carols one of the old
letters, "not a man sick since we have been
here. We have started twenty buffalo in a
drove&mdash;deer are plenty as sheep in New England.
Turkeys are innumerable. We have
already planted a field of one hundred and
fifty acres in corn." Another settler drips from
his ecstatic, and, we trust, veracious quill,
"The corn has grown nine inches in twenty-four
hours for two or three days past." The
garrison, very soon erected for defence and
called the Campus Martius in academic quaintness,
is described as the "handsomest pile of
buildings this side of the Alleghanies," and as
presenting an appearance of almost mediæval
stateliness and strength, bastioned as it was
with great blockhouses and surrounded by a
stout double wall of palisades. The Fourth of
July was celebrated by a great "banquet,"
eaten in a bowery set up on the banks of the
Muskingum; its menu tickles even a jaded
modern palate&mdash;venison barbecued, buffalo
steaks, bear-meat, roasted pigs, "the choicest
delicacy of all," and a great pike, six feet long,
the largest ever caught in the river. "We kept
it up till after twelve o'clock at night," succinctly
observes one of the participants, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
then went home and slept until after daylight."
On the fifteenth of July, a yet more memorable
occasion, General St. Clair, the first
Governor of the Northwest Territory, was
welcomed with great ceremonies, and the Ordinance
of 1787 was read with much solemnity
in the midst of profound silence. In
early August a pleasant little ripple of diversion
was caused by the arrival of the families
of the pioneers. In the latter part of the same
month, Dr. Cutler made a visit to the settlement,
and delivered the first sermon ever
preached at Marietta. In September was
opened the first Court of Common Pleas in
the Territory. It was an august spectacle.
The sheriff, Colonel Ebenezer Sproat, of the
Massachusetts line, preceded by a military
escort, marched with his drawn sword and
wand of office ahead of the governor, judges,
secretary and others, to the blockhouse where
the court was held. As the picturesque little
procession wound its way along the river
banks, the friendly Indians, loitering about the
new city, admired immensely the mighty form
of Colonel Sproat, who, being six feet four
inches tall, towered conspicuously above his
companions. Ever thereafter they called him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Hetuck, or Big Buckeye, and ever since then
the natives of Ohio have been dubbed "Buckeyes."</p>

<p>Great provisions were made for good order
in the settlement; almost before the seeds of
New England harvests had germinated in the
virgin soil, Marietta had her pillory, whipping post
and stocks for the discipline of evil-doers,
instruments of torture which lingered as late
as 1812. Every man was ordered to "entertain
emigrants, visit the sick, feed the hungry,
attend funerals, cabin-raising's, log-rollings,
huskings and to keep his latch-string always
out." Once during the fruitful summer the
settlers assembled to attend a funeral, for
the first death in the colony occurred in
August, when little Nabby Cushing, daughter
of Major Cushing, passed away. She was
buried tenderly in the alien soil, where, in an
unmarked grave, she is slumbering still. Although
many years have come and gone between,
a vague pity stirs to-day at the thought
of that little pioneer baby, whose feet so soon
grew weary in the vast wilderness.</p>

<p>The hospitality of the latch-strings was put to
the test two years later, when a hapless colony
of Frenchmen took shelter in the town, lured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
into the wilderness by the unscrupulous agent
of a land company, with the promise that
they should find a land where there were no
taxes to pay, no military services to be performed,
where frost, even in winter, was entirely
unknown and where candles grew
ready-made on the bushes and sugar dripped
spontaneously from the trees. They were a
curious crew: carvers, gilders, wig-makers and
hair-dressers from Paris, even a Viscount of
broken-down fortunes and a young Marquis,
with a few peasants as helpless as themselves
in the new conditions,&mdash;hardly a mother's son
of them able to plough or reap or chop for himself,
and many a man without a sou in his
pocket. The major part of them drifted down
the river that winter to what is now Gallipolis,
the City of the Gauls, where they at once began
to give balls in the cabins which the
Marietta settlers helped them build, and proceeded
to spend what little money they had in
hiring American hunters to bring them game!
A few became citizens of Marietta, notably
Monsieur Thiery, a Parisian baker and confectioner,
who quickly adapted himself to the
new life, and made toothsome little sweet-cakes
and bread for the settlement,&mdash;there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
tradition that while Louis Philippe was whiling
away his exile in the United States, he
visited Marietta, where he had the pleasure of
eating a fair wheaten loaf of his countryman's
baking, and Monsieur Cookie, bred to no
trade, very short and very stout, who wore at
all times and in all seasons a very tall steeple-crowned
hat which once saved his life, when
the Indians, catching sight of it bobbing up
and down in the paw-paw bushes, fired at it in
a vain attempt to hit the head within.</p>

<p>After the sober jollity of the first summer,
the Marietta colonists experienced the hardships
which every early settlement knows.
They had their "sick years, their times of
famine and their Indian wars." The sick
years played a sad havoc in their numbers by
dreadful scourges of epidemic diseases. The
famous starving-time came in the spring and
summer of 1790. A black frost falling out of
due season ruined their crops, and the Indians,
already beginning their hostilities, had driven
from the forest every startled wild thing within
their reach. It was a period that tried the
Puritan mettle, for the solace of religion may
prove vain if the stomach be empty. The only
food was nettle-tops and the tender shoots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of the pigeon-berry, boiled with a little corn
pounded on the hominy block. Occasionally
a hunter, faring far afield, brought in a bit of
bear-meat or a wild turkey, which made a feast
at least fitting if not full. The heroic matrons
sipped spice-bush tea, unsweetened, in lieu of
a more stimulating beverage. Many a heart
turned back in homesick longing to where the
blue haze curled comfortably from New England
kitchens, but hope returned with the early
squashes. The new corn crop was abundant,
and from that day to this, whatever may have
been their vicissitudes of fortune, the citizens
of Marietta have never again been reduced to
a starvation diet.</p>

<p>A much graver calamity, coming not long
after, was the Indian wars, which were not to
end for five long, weary years. During this
time the town was strained to its generous
capacity to receive under the shelter of the
Campus Martius the men, women and children
from remoter settlements. The settlers worked
in the fields like the Israelites at the rebuilding
of the walls of Jerusalem,&mdash;every man with
his weapon in his hand. On the puncheon
cabin-floors, mothers rocked their babies in the
first cradles of Ohio, while often, on some far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>-off
hill, they could see savage warriors brandishing
their blood-stained hatchets in defiance
at the fort.</p>

<p>The news of the defeat of General St. Clair's
expedition caused consternation, and threatened
for a time to break up the settlement. So disastrous
was the defeat that when in 1793 Mad
Anthony Wayne camped on the General's battlefield,
his soldiers could not lie down to sleep
for the bones of the unfortunate army. Humiliated
by his misfortune and its implied disgrace,
the Governor soon left his Marietta home.
The colonists mourned with his loss that of
his daughter Louisa, so brave, so lovely, so
brilliant, that it seems no mere legend that the
great Indian chief, Brandt, was madly in love
with her.</p>

<p>In the grim terror of the times, an amusing
incident now and then comes like a lilt of girlish
laughter. Once the signal gun gave the
alarm that the Indians were besieging the
town. The night was dark and the confusion
indescribable. Men rushed to their posts and
the women and children scuttled to the central
blockhouse. Colonel Sproat led the way with
a box of valuable papers; next came a woman
with her bed and children, and tumbling after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
her, old Mr. Moulton, with his leathern apron
full of goldsmith's tools and tobacco. His
daughter Anna carried the china tea-pot.
Lyddy brought the great Bible. When all
were in the frightened cry was raised that
Mrs. Moulton was missing&mdash;that she had been
scalped by the Indians. "Oh, no," said
Lyddy calmly, "she'll be here in a minute.
She stopped to put things a little to rights;
she said she <i>would not</i> leave the house <i>looking
so</i>." And in a few moments the old lady
scuttled in, bearing the looking-glass&mdash;a triumph
of New England housewifery!</p>

<p>A certain regularity of living was maintained
in spite of the continuous fear. Every Sabbath
morning church was held in a blockhouse
where Psalms were droned with Puritan unction,
and the sermon by Mr. Story, the scholarly
Massachusetts divine, was tasted with
much critical acumen by the learned backwoodsmen,
many of whom were graduates of
Harvard and Dartmouth. On the long Sabbath
afternoons the children of the settlement
studied their catechisms in the simple log
cabin of Mrs. Mary Lake, the earnest woman
who thus started what was perhaps the first
Sunday-school in the United States. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
week days they were gathered together for
lessons, nor was the rod kept in less perpetual
pickle because of the proximity of the
Indians.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_059.jpg">THE MILLS HOMESTEAD, MARIETTA.</a></div>

<p>The war once over, a busy activity ensued.
Mills were built, bridges made, and more
comfortable houses erected. It was not
strange that the sons of the old coast States,
with the siren voice of the sea still in their
ears, should become notable builders of ships.
The great trees of the forest were masts ready
for felling, and many a stately vessel slipped
into the water from this inland ship-yard, to
glide down the Ohio into the Mississippi, and
from thence to the shining ocean beyond.
The town became a centre of industry and
traffic, a position which she was not long to
keep, for gradually trade drifted from her, and
by and by she fell asleep commercially beside
her pleasant waters, to nod and dream serenely
through years to come. But not only was the
early Marietta noted for her industrial prosperity;
she was a centre of culture as well, and
her place in this regard she has never lost.
As soon as a greater wealth and leisure came
to the pioneer colony, there bloomed abundantly
the flowers of an intellectual refinement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
which was the birth-right of those heroic men
and women.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_061.jpg">HARMAN BLENNERHASSETT.</a><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></div>

<p>It is with this gracious era, redolent of sweet
old customs and stately courtesies, that there
is associated the romantic, old-time tragedy of
the Blennerhassetts. On the lovely island lying
some twelve miles below Marietta, Harman
Blennerhassett, the dreamy Irish exile, built his
idyllic mansion, whose grandeur was the wonder
of the West.</p>

<blockquote><p>"A shrubbery that Shenstone might have envied,"
wrote Wirt, "blooms around him. Music that might
have charmed Calypso and her nymphs, is his. An extensive
library spreads its treasures before him. A philosophical
apparatus offers him all the secrets and
mysteries of nature. Peace, tranquillity, and innocence
shed their mingled delights about him. And to crown
the enchantment of the scene, a wife, who is said to be
lovely even beyond her sex, and graced with every accomplishment
that can render it irresistible, has blessed
him with her love."</p></blockquote>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>
<img src="images/illo_063.jpg" width="200" alt="" title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">MRS. BLENNERHASSETT.</span>
</div>

<p>Here he plotted a new empire with the bad
and brilliant Aaron Burr, whose hands were
still red with the blood of the murdered Alexander
Hamilton; and from here he fled accused
of treason to his country, disgraced
and ruined. Memories of the "Blennerhassett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
days" are many, for the great man was for
several years a partner of Dudley Woodbridge,
the first merchant of Marietta, and both he
and his accomplished wife were familiar figures
in Marietta
homes. Fancy,
inspired by
local annals,
has a charming
glimpse of the
loving mistress
of the hospitable
mansion, dashing
through the
woods on her
spirited horse,
like some brilliant
tropical
bird, in her habit
of scarlet cloth,
and white hat
with the long
drooping plume. A pretty story is told of
her wit and beauty at the famous "Burr
ball" which the fashion of Marietta once gave
in honor of the crafty statesman and his
daughter Theodosia. To-day, the site of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
regal dwelling is marked only by an old well
and some magnificent trees. "Blennerhassett's
Island" is a point of attraction for pleasure-seekers,
who give little enough thought to its
sad story; but sometimes there journeys to
it a lover of past years who looks with blurred
eyes at the spot where once was enacted
one of the most pathetic little tragedies in
all American history.</p>

<p>But Marietta is not altogether a tale of
yesterdays; she has as well her to-day, with
its rich promise for the morrow. To-day, a
stranger in the town has pointed out to him
"New" and "Old" Marietta. In New Marietta,
brought into existence by the discovery
of vast surrounding oil-fields, there are thriving
factories, modern business blocks, new
hotels, improved school-buildings, electric cars;
there are evidences of wealth and business
prosperity, and signs of an increasing population.
This commercial progress, from a
civic standpoint, is undeniably a benefit, yet
it must be admitted, for the time being, it
gives Marietta a little the appearance of a
kindly, old-style grandmother, startled from
a long afternoon nap in the chimney-corner,
to find her cap gone, her scanty petticoats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
replaced by strangely ample frills, and the caraway
seeds in her limp black bag supplanted
by indigestible bon-bons. In Old Marietta the
scene shifts. Here is the drowsy peace of a
New England village; here are wide streets
shaded by avenues of splendid trees, and
ancient houses, generous-portalled, serene.
Here is the burring of bees in old-fashioned
gardens. And is not this lingering fragrance
the smell of the lotos-flower?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_065.jpg">MARIETTA COLLEGE BUILDINGS.</a></div>

<p>The glory of the old dispensation is the
venerable college, whose buildings cluster picturesquely
on the green lift of College Hill.
Founded in the fear of God by the first scholars
of Ohio, it has behind it a proud history.
At its head have stood men of rich culture and
ability, among whose names shines pre-eminently
that of Israel Ward Andrews. In the
list of its instructors have been scholars who
have led it upward to all that is noblest and
best. From its classes have gone out students
who have taken a fitting and often distinguished
place in the professions and in politics.
When the call of 1861 came, the student
sons of Marietta responded with a gallant
patriotism and a devoted service, some among
them winning the highest recognition. To-day, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
its able faculty, its fine library, its
well equipped class-rooms, it holds no mean
place in the roll of American colleges. It
pays to its past the precious thanks of a worthy
present. And with happy confidence it looks
forward to its future, under the guidance of its
sixth and latest President, Alfred Tyler Perry,
but recently called to its leadership from Hartford
Theological Seminary.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_067.jpg">MOUND CEMETERY, MARIETTA.</a><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></div>

<p>In the old Mound Cemetery sleep an honored
dead. In its center is the prehistoric
mound, as well preserved to-dayy as when it
was discovered by the pioneer fathers, a vast
monument to the unknown fittingly encircled
by the quiet dignity of this ancient Acre of
God. General Putnam's grave is marked by a
plain granite monument, bearing the simple
inscription more touching than the loftiest
eulogy:</p>

<p class="cen">GENERAL RUFUS PUTNAM<br />

And the leader of the<br />

<p>Not far from him are the majority of the
Revolutionary heroes who came with him from
New England. It is claimed that there are
buried here more officers of the Revolution
than in any other burying-ground in the United
States. About them lie thirteen soldiers of the
War of 1812, and a number of the brave men
who fought in the Mexican War. Here too,
are the resting-places of many early citizens of
Marietta, who are as a "Choir Invisible".</p>

<p>The gates are seldom open now to the silent
caravans, for the graves in the cloistral grass
lie close.</p>

<p>Many relics of bygone days make Old Marietta
interesting. The streets running north
and south bear yet the names given them by
the early settlers, of Washington and his generals.
The "Sacra Via" and the breezy
"Capitolium" and "Tiber Way" bear witness
to an old scholarship. "The Point" recalls
the picketed Point of the Indian wars. There
still stands the Ohio Company's Land Office,
a wee, weather-beaten building, gray with
time, probably the oldest structure in Ohio.
Opposite this is the old homestead of Rufus
Putnam, which stood within the Campus Martius.
On the park, fronting the river, is the
quaint Two Horn Church of the Congregationalists,
erected in the wilderness in 1806
and now Ohio's oldest church building. On
the same street where it stands is the stately
old mansion of Governor Meigs, which was
built two years earlier and which still holds an
honored place among Marietta's beautiful
homes. In families whose names mark their
descent from the "forty-eight immortals" are
treasured numerous heirlooms,&mdash;ancestral por<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>traits
which look from their tarnished frames
pink-cheeked, confident and calm; old dresses,
dim and faintly odorous; and divers warming-pans,
candlesticks and Blennerhassett chairs,
together with sundry bits of sprigged, delightful
china.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_071.jpg">OLD TWO HORN CHURCH.</a></div>

<p>"Age is a recommendation in four things,"
runs a Spanish proverb: "Old wood to burn,
old wine to drink, old friends to trust, old
books to read." To these might well be added
a fifth,&mdash;old towns to love. To those who
know her, Marietta is a hallowed spot. She is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
a tender-bosomed matron, this mother of many
sons. Around her is a fair line of hills, which,
whether green with the eternal promise of the
spring, or wrapped in the blue smoke from
autumn's invisible battlefield, or hoary with
winter's snows, are changelessly beautiful.
About her are broad fields, now quivering to
their resurrection, now white to the harvests.
Before her are the lovely, far-stretching rivers,
calling to her all day long with their old, sweet
notes of running water. By the bonds of her
historic beauty she holds her children in a very
tender thrall. In all times, and in all places,
their hearts yearn unto her in the far Horatian
cry: "Septimius,&mdash;<i>that angle of the earth
laughs for me beyond all others</i>!"</p>

<h2>CLEVELAND<br />

THE PLEASANT CITY</h2>

<p class="chapby">By CHARLES F. THWING</p>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">T</span>HE first thing to be said about Cleveland
is what, with the change of a pronoun, a
Cambridge poet said about one of whom he
wrote: "It is so pleasant." Its streets are
pleasant to live in and to look upon; its parks
are pleasant to stroll in or to ride in; its houses
are, on the whole, pleasant to the æsthetic
sense; its libraries are pleasant for their selectness
though not for their bigness; its people
are, above all, pleasant for their dignity, graciousness,
genuineness, simplicity and appreciation.
In the year 1838 the late Asa Gray
spent a short time in Cleveland, and wrote
from Cleveland to a friend, saying that the
city would "ultimately be a very pleasant
place"; he adds: "The people show some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
signs of civilization; they eat ice cream, which
is sold in many places."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I wish I were able to
assure my old friend and neighbor, as he now
lives with the immortelles and other fadeless
flowers, that he has proved to be a true prophet:
Cleveland has become a "very pleasant place,"
and possibly I might be allowed to assure him
that signs of the ice-age of modern civilization
still linger.</p>

<p>In that relation in which men commonly use
the word "pleasant," the weather, Cleveland is
not pleasant. It has as much cloudy weather
as almost any part of the world; and yet it has
a pleasant climate. Its summers are not hot, its
winters not cold. To the worker of any sort this
pleasant climate of much unpleasant weather
is very pleasing, for in it, as in the climate of
London, one can get much work out of himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_075.jpg">VIEW IN GORDON PARK.</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span></div>

<p>Cleveland is a singular creation of contraries.
It is an inland town, but it builds more
vessels and owns more vessels than almost
any other in the United States. About a
quarter of all the steel vessels, rated in tonnage,
built in the United States in the
last fiscal year of the Government were constructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
in Cleveland, the order of precedence
being Cleveland, Newport News, Chicago,
and Detroit; and almost three quarters of the
modern steel ships in service on the Great Lakes
are owned or operated by Cleveland vesselmen.
It is a city of four hundred thousand people,
but it impresses both the visitor and the resident
as a big village or a series of big villages.
From it can be reached in a long or short
night's ride, New York and Chicago, Buffalo
and St. Louis, Detroit and Cincinnati; within
seven hundred miles of Cleveland dwell more
than half the entire population of the country,
and yet Cleveland has been called provincial.
Its homes are among the most palatial of the
world, but the owners of not a few are more at
home in New York and Paris than on Euclid
Avenue. It is distinguished for its iron, steel
and coal interests, but it has scholars and
teachers who are known where its steel rails
have never been carried. It is a city of
the East, and it is also a city of the West&mdash;of
the East it is the newest, of the West it is
the oldest. It is often called conservative, but
it is also distinguished by its sense of power
and of progress. It represents in its citizens a
pure New England type; but it has also gath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>ered
up folks from all over the world,&mdash;"Parthians,
and Medes, and Elamites, ... strangers
of Rome, Jews and proselytes, Cretes and
Arabians," who read their newspapers in a
dozen different languages. But, be it said, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
New England, the Connecticut and Massachusetts
type still dominates. The names of
the families which are most representative of
the things of the spirit include a large number
of New England names.</p>

<p>This city of contraries and of contrasts is
yet made a great city by only one or two simple
elements. One may say that Lake Erie makes
Cleveland. Were there no Lake Erie there
would be no Cleveland. But Lake Erie is the
occasion and not the cause. One may say that
the age of steel makes Cleveland. But that this
age is the age of steel is only the condition, not
the cause. The cause that makes Cleveland
Cleveland is that at or near Cleveland the
various elements that are necessary in the
manufacture of iron and steel can be most
economically and efficiently assembled. The
iron ores from the Lake Superior region, the
coal from the Massillon, Mohoning and Pennsylvania
region, the limestone from the Lake
Erie islands and southern shores, can here be
most profitably brought together. Cleveland
is, too, by rail and by boat a good point for the
distribution of the finished product as well as a
good point for the bringing together of the
crude material. Here ore, coal and lime meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and mingle as naturally as the heat of the
sun and the life of the seed unite in the
springtime. Nothing can prevent their meeting,
and little can subsidies or other artificial
stimulus do to promote it. From this union
spring forth factories making nuts and bolts
and sewing-machines and engines and the thousand
products and by-products of this age and
place of steel. Therefore Cleveland is Cleveland.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_080.jpg">SOLDIERS' AND SAILORS' MONUMENT, CLEVELAND.</a></div>

<p>It may not only be said that Cleveland is
herself; it should also be added that Cleveland
has done some things first which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
worth doing anyway, and which are especially
worth doing first. As among the colleges
Williams and Harvard have done not a few
first things, so among the cities Cleveland
may claim a certain priority. The city was,
if not the first, among the first to adopt the
federal system of municipal government, a
system which, after ten years of usefulness,
has proved to be like every other form of
democratic government, good if good men
are in control, and bad if bad men are in
control. Cleveland was the first to adopt the
proper method for the government and administration
of its public schools, namely the
separation of the business side of the administration
from the educational, a system, too,
which, like the more general plan of government,
finds its efficiency in the character of the
men who administer it. In Cleveland, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
was organized the great Epworth League of
the Methodist Episcopal Church. Here, too,
one of the first women in America to enter the
medical profession was trained in the old
Medical College, now a part of the Western
Reserve University. Here the recondite experiments
were made by Morley for determining
the atomic weight of oxygen, and
practical experiments by Brush for giving
the best light, as well as the important
experiments also made by Brush which resulted
in adding "etherion" to the elements.
Here, also, important facilities in the use of
the public library and in the making of finest
machinery, such as is used in astronomical
apparatus, were first applied. One, too, should
not in a commercial age be suffered to forget
that in Cleveland the Standard Oil Company
was born and grew to be a lusty youth.</p>

<p>This city of first things had as its first
man and founder, one whose name it bears,
Moses Cleveland. A Connecticut man, born
in Canterbury, Windham County, in 1754,
graduated at Yale in 1777, admitted to the
bar, interrupting his professional practice by
service in the Revolutionary army, serving in
the Connecticut Legislature and also in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
State militia, Moses Cleveland was made
agent for the Connecticut Land Company in
1796, and came into the historic territory of
New Connecticut, or the Western Reserve.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
He seems to have had those elements which
usually are found in founders of states and
builders of cities. Reserved in speech, vigorous
in action, friendly with all, grave,
shrewd, he was born to command. His career
was brief: he died in the town of his birth
in 1806; but he lived long enough to entertain
a rational hope of the future greatness
of the city he founded and named. It is said
that he once remarked: "While I was in New
Connecticut I laid out a town, on the bank of
Lake Erie, which was called by my name, and
I believe the child is now born that may live
to see it grow as large as old Windham."</p>

<p>Moses Cleveland was a prophet at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
true and false. Cleveland became as large
as old Windham and even larger, in the
lifetime of children born in the last decade
of the eighteenth century. The method
by which Cleveland has attained the first
place in its State, and the seventh place in
the United States, is a process, a growth,
and not a manufacture. In the year 1830,
thirty-four years after the coming of Moses
Cleveland, it had only a thousand people;
but the one thousand had increased to six
thousand by 1840, and in the next ten
years the six thousand increased threefold.
In the next ten years the number more than
doubled, becoming forty-three thousand in
1860, and yet again doubled in the following
decade. By 1870, it had become ninety-two
thousand. The doubling process could not
long continue, but it came so near it that in
1880 there were one hundred and sixty thousand
inhabitants, in 1890 two hundred and
sixty thousand and more, and in 1900 almost
four hundred thousand.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_084.jpg">ARMORY OF THE CLEVELAND GRAYS.</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span></div>

<p>A growth more normal and steady, a growth
which has also carried along with itself elements
far more precious than mere size, it
would be hard to find. For these folks do
not deserve the epithet which Carlyle applied
to London's millions. They are a people of
vigor, initiative, progressiveness, carefulness,
wealth, work, comfortableness, and good-heartedness.
Cleveland may be conservative; but
it is the conservatism of the English nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
which Emerson describes in saying: "The
slow, deep English mass smoulders with fire,
which at last sets all its borders in flame."
Cleveland's fires are the fires of anthracite
and not of straw.</p>

<p>A city of comfort, Cleveland has no London's
East End. I do not believe that in any
other population of the world of its size can
be found so few hungry stomachs or homeless
bodies. Work abounds. All men work.
Its rich men are workers, and, what is far
more exceptional, the sons of its rich men are
workers. Its wealth is of the solid sort. It
represents investments which pay dividends
every six months, and which represent the
advancement of every commercial and manufacturing
interest. But Cleveland is obliged to
acknowledge that not a few of its rich men
are legal citizens of New York City, ostracized
from its pleasant borders by what they and
others regard as the unjust tax laws of the
State.</p>

<p>The city has not yet reached the condition in
which it is understood that in case a will is probated
representing a large estate which fails to
give at least a considerable sum to charity or
to education, the court shall set it aside on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
ground that the testator was of unsound mind.
Of course money is given away both by gift
and by bequest, but more, on the whole, by gift
than by bequest, and in large amounts, but
not in amounts so large as prevail in communities
of an age of two hundred and seventy-five
years rather than of one hundred. The
rate of increase which money may make for
itself is so great, that the holder and the maker
hesitate to part with such a remunerative
agent. Yet the beneficence viewed in the light
of decades is great. A noble school of science,
a noble college and university, including
professional schools, a noble foundation for an
art school, are easily found among the more
obvious tokens. Hospitals and orphanages,
private schools, endowed churches, Young
Men's Christian Association buildings, parks
and college settlements, are ready proof of
private beneficence for public ends. Testimony
should also be borne to the wisdom as
well as the generosity which characterize the
giving of this people. My pen refuses to
write names, but it is free to say that to find
beneficence which is, it shall not be said so
little harmful, but which is so gloriously efficient,
as the beneficence of some of Cleveland's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
noblest women and men would be difficult.
With the gift, before the gift, and after the
gift goes the wisdom as well as the graciousness
of the giver. One, too, should not neglect to
say that in not a few of the great manufacturing
concerns of Cleveland prevails a spirit that
the employer owes to the employee something
more than wages. The dividend to labor consists,
in the more obvious relations, in providing
rest and recreation rooms, facilities for
eating the midday luncheon, and in doing
what can be done in creating associations and
conditions which make for the enrichment of
life and the betterment of character.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_087.jpg">LAKE IN WADE PARK, SHOWING ADELBERT COLLEGE IN THE DISTANCE.</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span></div>

<p>Of course Cleveland has societies and clubs:
clubs into which the worthiest life of the community
naturally organizes itself for worthiest
purposes, and clubs which represent the life
that is simply worthy and of which the purposes
are not the highest. Clubs of women
and clubs of men, clubs social and clubs professional,
clubs literary and clubs commercial,
clubs anthropological and clubs sociological,
clubs chemical and clubs engineering, clubs
collegiate and clubs pedagogical, clubs athletic
and clubs æsthetic, clubs piscatorial and clubs
ecclesiastical, clubs architectural and clubs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
free-traders, clubs for municipal improvement
and clubs for no improvement of any kind&mdash;they
all and many others are found in this
very pleasant city.</p>

<p>And underneath all these associations and organizations
it is easy to discover the growth of
a distinctly civic spirit, also manifest in special
movements and conditions. The endeavor to
build in one group buildings so important as a
county court-house, a city hall, a public library
and others reveals the willingness to surrender
individual advantages to the public weal. The
attempt to deal largely and justly with all
municipal franchises proves the presence of a
desire to serve all as well as each. The Municipal
Association, an organization of a few
gentlemen of high purpose and of patience as
well as of great influence, has, in recommending
or in refusing to recommend certain candidates
for office, promoted the growth of a public
sense out of which it has itself sprung. The
determination that the public schools shall not
be used for partisan purposes is perhaps as
strong an illustration as could be given of the
presence and potency of the civic spirit of
Cleveland.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_090.jpg">PERRY'S MONUMENT, WADE PARK, CLEVELAND.</a></div>

<p>In the three great professions are found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
noble members. In this triple service is manifest
a high tableland of general excellence
rather than a level broken by high and distinct
peaks of individual conspicuousness. The
highest relative standing belongs, I judge, to
the members of the medical profession. This
prominence may be the result of the presence
for more than fifty years of a medical school
which has numbered among its faculty some
great investigators and teachers. But not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
few of those who are examples of highest
service have been unwilling, it must be said,
to remain in Cleveland. As the Atlantic
draws down the level of the Great Lakes, so the
territory of the Atlantic draws away some
(not all) of the more eminent members of the
great professions. The supply however never
becomes exhausted, nor does it deteriorate.</p>

</div>
<p>But the most eminent of Cleveland's people
belong to the literary or political class
rather than to the strictly professional. The
earliest of the writers who spread Cleveland's
fame and his own was Artemus Ward. It
was a short career
enough
which Artemus
Ward had, and
its Cleveland
part covered
only two years,
but while it lasted
it bore one of
Cleveland's daily
papers round the
world on the
wings of his wit.
One cannot forget
that here
lived and wrote John Hay, beloved as among
the best of men as well as honored as the
most efficient of Secretaries of State. James
Ford Rhodes here fitted himself while engaged
in business to begin his career as a
fascinating writer of later American history.
Constance Fenimore Woolson was a Cleve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>land
child, although not born here, and the
Great Lakes are the scenes of her stories.
Mrs. Sarah Knowles Bolton, writer of useful
and pleasing biographies and other books,
divides her residence between Boston and
Cleveland. Charles W. Chesnutt, too, is
esteemed not only for his sketches but also for
a distinct charm of character. Cleveland
would like to claim that rare poet and great
soul, Edward Rowland Sill, for his home was
only a few miles away, and in Cleveland he
died, in 1887. One should not decline to say
that books written by college professors may
not only be the material for literature but also
literature itself. Such books, written in Cleveland,
are neither few nor barren.</p>

<p>The eminence in politics of the Cleveland
man belongs rather to the present than to the
past. If one should name the gentlemen who
have served the city in the national Congress
the names would to most prove to be without
significance. The name of Senator Payne&mdash;and
he had been long associated with the life
of the city&mdash;one recalls, but no name has the
meaning of the name of Wade or of Giddings,
who came from the little town of Jefferson, a
few miles east of Cleveland, or of Sherman,
who came from the south. Hayes, Garfield
and McKinley might be called citizens of the
Greater Cleveland. At the present time,
however, in both the Senate and the House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the city is not without able and significant
representation.</p>

<p>Like a piece of music the chapter returns upon
itself. It began with the argument that Cleveland
is so pleasant. From the breakwater
which the Government builds to keep Cleveland
great and to make it greater, along the
avenues of residence or of trade, even through
its smoky and sooty atmosphere,&mdash;sign of
prosperity,&mdash;out mile after mile to the city of
the dead where the well-beloved Garfield
sleeps in nobly wrought sepulchre, in all and
through all, Cleveland is pleasant. Pleasant
to live in, pleasant to work in, I know, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
pleasant to go to heaven from, I hope, is
Cleveland.</p>

<h2>CINCINNATI<br />

ALWAYS A STRATEGIC POINT</h2>

<p class="chapby">By MILTON E. AILES</p>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">O</span>N the day before Christmas, 1788, twenty-six
adventurous men, in deerskin hunting
shirts and leggins, with tomahawk, powder-horn
and scalping knife at their belts, embarked
at Limestone on the Ohio River in
rude barges of their own construction, and
fighting their way through dangerous floes, proceeded
on a journey which was to prove memorable
in the annals of American colonization.</p>

<p>These pilgrims were well aware of the perils
and tragedies awaiting them, for their mission
was to build them homes and found a city on
the edge of the rich Miami Valley, through
which mixed tribes of raging Shawnees, Senecas,
Iroquois and Miamis roamed, determined
to halt the threatening advance of the hated
paleface.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indian braves realized that a crucial
moment in their history had come. Their
allies, the British, had gone down in defeat
before the Thirteen Fires. Henceforth the
tribes must look to their own councils, and
rely upon their own strength, and they swore
grimly that the Ohio should run with blood,
and that the advent of every western pioneer
should bring an additional scalp for the grewsome
decoration of their lodges.</p>

<p>But these hardy voyagers, now celebrating
a frugal Christmas as they steered their course
down the swollen and half-frozen Ohio, were
not to be turned aside by impending conflict
with savage tribes. To meet grave danger
like brave men was for them no new experience;
they had passed through seven years
of revolution; they had stood the trying tests
of honorable hardships, and were now making
their way to found a community which was
to develop within a few generations into one
of the greatest inland cities of the world.
Four days they fought their way through
floating masses of débris and ice, finally finding
their haven in Sycamore Inlet, opposite
the mouth of the Licking River. To-day the
traveller, smoking meditatively in a Pullman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
will cover the same distance before he has
occasion to light a fresh cigar.</p>

<p>In a grove of sycamores, osiers and water
maples they struck their flint and built their
fires. There was no theatrical assertion of
dominion, nor is it on record that sacred rites
were invoked to consecrate the struggle for
civilization that was to centre round this far
outpost of the Republic, and yet their first
performance was one of the most dramatic incidents
in western history; for, knowing that
savage armies lurked in the dim woods that
overhung the terraces above them, these
twenty-six hardy Anglo-Saxons dismantled the
crafts that had carried them into the far wilderness,
and converted the planks and timbers of
their barges into cabins. There was to be no
retreat. In the name of the new Democracy,
they established the primitive beginnings of a
great city in the very centre of the famous
Indian path over which for unnumbered centuries
naked aborigines from the Great Lakes
to the Kentucky hunting grounds had hurried
to battle or the chase.</p>

<p>The new settlement thus became a bold and
significant challenge to the red man, and in its
fate was involved the future of the West and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of the nation. The earthquake of war, which
the founding of Cincinnati invited, was not long
delayed, and when it came it startled Washington
from his incomparable composure, and
shook the Republic to its foundations.</p>

<p>From the moment of its inception, Cincinnati
was the most important point on the Ohio
River. Other settlements, it is true, at the
start hoped to outstrip Cincinnati in population.
There was Marietta, founded two months
before, which had a more romantic birth.
And there was North Bend, which enjoyed the
personal backing of John Cleves Symmes, the
famous pioneer who superintended the first
development of the Miami Valley, and from
whom Denman, Patterson and Filson, the
promoters of the settlement that subsequently
became Cincinnati, purchased the site of that
city. These and other settlements along the
river were, for a time, pointed to with pride
by their founders as the coming commercial
centres. Cincinnati, moreover, began life
with an impossible name. Filson, a fantastic
pedagogue who had drifted into Kentucky,
combining a smattering of tongues with an
unbridled imagination, compounded the name
"Losantiville," which means when interpreted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
"the village opposite the mouth of the Licking."
Historians, in malign humor, seem to
rejoice in the sudden translation of this picturesque
polyglot and town-site boomer, remarking
with a certain gleeful unanimity of phrase
that "shortly after naming the settlement he
was scalped by the Indians."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_101.jpg">TYLER-DAVIDSON FOUNTAIN.</a><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></div>

<p>The offer of free lots to original settlers did
not give Cincinnati pre-eminence, for similar
lures were held out by other aspiring communities
along the Ohio; nor will it be seriously
contended that the location there of Fort
Washington, although this made the spot the
headquarters of the American army in the
Northwest, gave Cincinnati a superior start,
for the sense of security expected because of
the presence of the United States garrison
was not abiding. General Harmar marched to
defeat in 1790 from this pioneer fort and
arsenal, and the victorious savages pursued
him until their cries of exultation terrified
the little hamlet clustered about the military
station.</p>

<p>Then came St. Clair, bold and assertive.
Heroes of the Revolution had founded the
town. The fort had been named in honor of the
great General and President, and as both town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and fort represented the extension into the
West of that democratic strength of arms which
had humbled the most powerful kingdom of
Europe, this new settlement from which civilization
was to radiate into the western valleys
should be dignified with the name of the order
that held together in fraternal bond the grizzled
survivors of the great war. And so Losantiville,
the dream of a bizarre scholar, became
Cincinnati.</p>

<p>In the name of that order and city, St.
Clair went to war. But sickness laid him
low, and he was carried to the field of battle
wrapped in flannels. Managing the forces
against him was Thayendanegea, the celebrated
Mohawk, or Joseph Brandt, as the English
called him, as astute as Tecumseh and as
fearless. Thayendanegea had been secretary
to Sir Guy Johnson. He had learned
the tactics of civilized armies, and with masterful
native cunning he planned to annihilate
the forces of St. Clair. Nearly fifteen
hundred officers and men marched away from
Cincinnati to crush the semi-savage captain
who had directed the massacres of Minisink
and Wyoming, and back to Cincinnati in
rout and dishonor, their guns and blankets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
abandoned, rushed in unspeakable terror a
pitiful five hundred. Before sundown on the
day of that battle, November 4, 1791, nearly a
thousand scalps of white men dangled from
the wigwams of the armies of Thayendanegea.</p>

<p>Other communities along the Ohio looked
with envy upon the federal ramparts at Cincinnati,
but the protection afforded by the
garrison was at first more fanciful than real.
The pioneer clergymen of the town ventured
to Sabbath services cautiously, rifle in hand,
peering down the dim aisles hewn through
dense woods of linden and birch that led to a
clearing, in the midst of which some charred
stump served as a pulpit; or, as congregations
grew, a log-built chapel housed the earnest
worshippers. And by the law of Cincinnati
and the territory every communicant was required
to go to the altar with loaded firearms,
that savages, taking advantage of the hour of
prayer to attack the town, might be repulsed.
Even when pews were built to give regularity
to worship, the brethren were commanded to sit
at the outer end, with their rifles in readiness.</p>

<p>If Fort Washington had not been built or
had been located elsewhere, Cincinnati would
have still become the metropolis of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Ohio. Here water highways crossed. And
as it marked the path over which the red men
had passed for ages, so now it became the
intersecting point of civilized adventure. Out
of the shadows of the Licking in their pirogues
Daniel Boone and George Rogers Clark had
hurried across the Ohio to watch hostile campfires
from the Cincinnati hills, and thence had
descended upon the barbarians to avenge
crimes committed in Kentucky. The long
beaches at the Cincinnati site afforded safe
landing, while the settlement, secure upon the
higher ground and the succession of terraces
beyond, could not be engulfed by the periodical
river floods. North and south the rivers
that mingled their waters here furnished natural
pathways to vast and fertile valleys.</p>

<p>Here, too, a vanished race once had had
a city or perhaps a capital, for Cincinnati is
built upon extensive prehistoric ruins of the
Mound Builders. It was a walled city with
great gates, pyramids and sacrificial altars,
and over these surviving memorials of a people
whose origin and destiny are alike a mystery
grew, when Cincinnati was founded, oak, beech,
sycamore and cedar, whose concentric rings
revealed that hundreds of years had elapsed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
since the disappearance of the race which had
reared these shrines and tombs and city walls.
Among the prehistoric pottery, the polished
pipes of catlinite and stone axes such as a
race of troglodytes might have swung to brain
abhorrent monsters of forgotten periods, they
will show you in the artistic Cincinnati Museum
in Eden Park, the famed Cincinnati
Tablet exhumed from a tumulus near Fifth
and Mound streets in that city. Some antiquarians
believe the sculptured stone to be
an astronomical calendar or a table of measurement
and calculation. Some have imagined
it to be a sacred relic from the tomb of kings.
Nearby, in the same museum, you see records
lucidly deciphered from the second Theban
dynasty, and carved inscriptions, intelligently
translated, from the balustrade of the temple
of Athene, but scholarship is dumb and
imagination is the only interpreter of these
strange mementos of a race which found in
the site of Cincinnati a natural spot for the
building of a large and fortified city.</p>

<p>Although the star of empire may have been
destined at all hazards to pause over Cincinnati
until the tenth census of the United States
should show that the center of the nation's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
population had moved westward to that city,
there was grave alarm in the settlement when
the soldiers of St. Clair arrived in confusion
and defeat.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_107.jpg">ENTRANCE TO SPRING GROVE CEMETERY.</a><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></div>

<p>Generations have thrilled over the story of
the officer on horseback, who, bearing important
news, hurried to the President, tossed his
bridle reins to an orderly and leaped up the
steps of Washington's reception room only to
find that the Chief Executive was dining with
distinguished visitors and could not be disturbed.
The officer was so importunate and
so impressive that the secretary was impelled
to grant him audience. The grave President
listened without visible emotion to the whispered
message from Cincinnati, the officer
departed, and Washington returned to the
banquet table. Not one of his guests could
guess that beneath the calm exterior the far-seeing
statesman was experiencing one of the
most tragic moments of his career. It was not
merely that a trusted general had minimized
warning and had met defeat, for Washington
had devoted a long life to warfare against
both savage and civilized foes, and he was not
to be easily moved by the uncertain fortune
of battles. But he knew that the defeat which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the soldiers of Cincinnati had encountered now
threatened the destiny of the country. The
East and West were not yet riveted by steel
rails into coherent union. Beyond the Alleghanies
there were projects of a protectorate
under France or Spain, or both, and bolder
dreams of a Kentucky republic. With few
connecting links with the East, what could hold
the western empire, since the federal government
had displayed inability to protect the pioneers?
Washington's guests departed unaware
that their illustrious host who had entertained
them with consummate decorum had during
those hours felt the nation slipping beneath his
feet. But when they had gone the pent spirit
of the great leader, in one of the few instances
of his lifetime, found expression in tumultuous
grief and rage. He voiced in advance the storm
of public protest, indignation and fear that broke
out when the dismal tidings from Cincinnati
became known. And when Congress learned
that Washington favored the creation of an
army of five thousand to avenge the defeat of
Harmar and St. Clair, there was little in the resourceful
vocabulary of political abuse spared
the President. Anti-expansionists called him
an imperialist bent on converting the Republic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
into an empire. Why send an army to inevitable
slaughter beyond mountain frontiers
in a vain struggle for the wilderness of the Indians
when the colonies then possessed more
domain than the citizens of the Republic would
ever be able to use?</p>

<p>Fortunately the anti-expansionists, while
mordant and powerful, could not prevail, and
the war measures became law. Anthony
Wayne, whose daring during the Revolution
had won for him the admiring sobriquet of
"Mad," then took command and hastened to
Cincinnati but none too soon. The Six Nations
with Little Turtle as their spokesman had followed
up their victories by demands that Cincinnati,
the capital of the Northwest, should
be abandoned and that the Ohio should mark
the perpetual boundary between the white
man and the red. British arms bristled behind
this native ultimatum, and at the rapids
of the Maumee, as if to stay Wayne's advance,
British forces built a fort and garrisoned it
with three companies. The fears of Washington
seemed about to be realized.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_111.jpg">RACE STREET, CINCINNATI.</a><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></div>

<p>But at the battle of Fallen Timbers "Mad
Anthony" scattered the allied tribes like forest
leaves. Nearly half a hundred mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
chiefs fell in that historic engagement, and in
their defeat the Indians christened their conquerer
"Big Thunder" and for years trembled
when they heard his name. Cincinnati and
Ohio were saved to the Republic.</p>

<p>Wayne in his campaign and in his no less
notable treaties was brilliantly seconded by a
young man who, unannounced and unwelcomed,
landed at Cincinnati on the day the
broken columns of St. Clair fell back upon
the fort. The generals there looked upon
his smooth cheeks and his boyish frame
with soldierly disdain, one remarking that he
would as readily send his sister to the front as
entrust this beardless neophyte with the responsibilities
of border warfare. This youth,
in whose veins flowed the blood of one of
Cromwell's generals, was to shame his flippant
critics, for he was to win a lieutenancy at the
battle of Fallen Timbers, and rising steadily
in the service of his country was to become
a western Napoleon, avenging the disasters of
the River Basin and Detroit, defeating the
powerful Tecumseh at Tippecanoe, laying firm
and broad the foundations of northwestern
statehood, serving in the Senate of the United
States, and finally going in triumph to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
White House. Cincinnati has fostered many
famous sons, but none greater than William
Henry Harrison.</p>

<p>To many new communities the first settlers
have gone with the hope of returning with fortunes
to their former homes. Cincinnati was
founded and developed by men and women
who came to stay. Harrison identified himself
with the West at the start by marrying the
daughter of John Cleves Symmes, the Miami
pioneer, and to the Harrison homestead near
Cincinnati, which for a quarter of a century
had been an American mecca, the body of the
famous General was borne for burial.</p>

<p>From the start, self-reliance has been a prevailing
characteristic of Cincinnati. Its isolation
in the days of the canoe, the barge and the
pack-horse, developed its originality. A copy
of the <i>Centinel of the Northwest Territory</i>,
published in 1794, graphically illustrates its
remoteness at that period, for news from Marietta
had been eight days in arriving, Lexington
dispatches were twenty-one days old, fifty-six
days had been consumed in getting the
latest information from New York, and European
news antedated the day of issue four
months and a half. It was natural among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
such conditions that the city should look to
itself as the centre of interest, and hence at an
early day the journals of Cincinnati, instead of
canvassing distant localities for belated sensations,
were encouraging local writers to entertain
the public. It was the press of Cincinnati
that first gave the poems of Alice and Ph&oelig;be
Cary to the world, and they repaid it by conferring
immortality in the world of letters
upon the blue Miami, where they spent the
simple years of their girlhood. And thither,
because of the fame their singing had won
them, traveled Horace Greeley and other celebrities
of the day to do these gifted sisters
homage. In Cincinnati was born Gen. Wm.
H. Lytle, author of <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, and
it was the journalism of that city that gave inspiration
to his pen. Here, too, was directed the
early genius of Wm. D. Howells, Rutherford
B. Hayes, Salmon P. Chase, and other men
who have dignified literature or public life.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_115.jpg">CITY HALL, CINCINNATI.</a><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></div>

<p>Savage yells had not ceased to echo in its
surrounding woods before music began to
charm in Cincinnati. Even before Wayne
came to silence the exultant war-cries of the
tribes, Thomas Kennedy, in whose honor a
street in Covington is named, used to entertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the frontier society with his fiddle, and a
Mr. McLean, a butcher, took time to train the
voices of the primitive colony. The Rev.
Daniel Doty, who visited Cincinnati at an
early day, was shocked at the singing and
fiddling and dancing in the log cabins, as if the
people "feared not God nor regarded Indians."
Music, since directed in large measure by the
German element in the city, has by its Chorus,
its musical groves, its Saengerbund, Haydn
Society, and other clubs, imparted distinction
to Cincinnati and made it the Vienna of the
American continent.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that the pioneer butcher
of the city found time from his chopping blocks
to strike the tuning-fork, for Cincinnati, even
after the location there of Fort Washington,
was many times on the verge of starvation,
and would have starved but for the timely help
of frontier hunters under the noted Colonel
Wallace, who brought the meat of buffalo, bear
and deer to the stricken settlement. To-day
the city dines well. In truth, it is famed for
its good cheer and its bohemian independence.</p>

<p>Cincinnati is a city of homes and churches,
and singularly free from the crime that prowls
in the slums of other cities. Therefore some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of its citizens take pride that the city is credited
with being one of the greatest whiskey
markets in America, that forty-three breweries
and storage vaults are in demand, and that
the city annually turns out 49,000,000 packs
of playing-cards, making it the largest center
of this industry in the world.</p>

<p>In many industries Cincinnati leads. The
wealth of cities throughout the continent is
locked in banks and vaults manufactured in
Cincinnati. The cowboys on the plains and
the horsemen on city paddocks sit in saddles
fashioned in Cincinnati. Cigars by the millions
in this country are packed in boxes manufactured
in Cincinnati. It produces more schoolbooks
than any other city, and is near the head
of the list in turning out religious publications.</p>

<p>On the 22d of February, 1794, a canoe left
Cincinnati with a federal mailbag consigned
to Pittsburg. This marked the beginning of
regular service with the East. In early days,
a Cincinnati merchant seeking to buy goods
in New York consumed sixty days in making
the journey to the metropolis. To-day
he may lunch in the Queen City, take a
train and lunch the following noon in Manhattan.
Long before the advent of railways,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Cincinnati became a center of travel and distribution.
As early as 1801, a full-rigged brig
took on a cargo at Cincinnati and set sail for
the West Indies. Not long after, and many
years before Fulton turned his attention to
Western waters, citizens of Cincinnati met at
Yeatman's Tavern to consider a "contrivance
for transporting boats against the current by
the power of steam or elastic vapor," but without
tangible results; and, in fact, when the
first steamboat did paddle noisily past the city
the circumstance was dignified with only a
four-line notice in the Cincinnati press.</p>

<p>Before long, however, the steamboat revolutionized
river travel, and thenceforth Cincinnati
leaped by bounds from a village to a great city,
and every recurrent trip of these harbingers of
vast commerce seemed to find a new suburb
springing into bustling life on the Cincinnati
uplands.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_119.jpg">CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, CINCINNATI.</a><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></div>

<p>The fact that this city was originally included
and still remains in the New Orleans
customs district shows its accessibility to ocean
traffic. Its superiority in water communication
is shown by a computation made by the
Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce regarding
the relative cost of transporting freight from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
points of origin to all parts of the United
States. The comparisons per 100 pounds
are as follows: From Cincinnati, 81 cents;
Chicago, 84 cents; St. Louis, 88 cents; Minneapolis,
$1.22. A similar computation applicable
to a radius of 600 miles from the point
of origin gives the following averages per 100
pounds: From Cincinnati, 66 cents; Chicago,
73 cents; St. Louis, 75 cents; Minneapolis,
$1.11.</p>

<p>While growing into greatness, Cincinnati
did not forget, in the critical times of the Civil
War, its honorable history as the former outpost
of the Republic. Its trade was largely
with the South, but sternly its citizens decided
that arguments in favor of trade interests
smacked of treason, and with stoic heroism
closed the city to rebellion. And when Lew
Wallace, fortifying Cincinnati to anticipate
attack, called for volunteers, the whole community
responded, and from the Ohio valleys
came the sharp-shooting "squirrel hunters" in
procession seemingly endless to defend the
city.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_121.jpg">SUSPENSION BRIDGE.</a><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></div>

<p>Since then the growth of Cincinnati has
been in keeping with the development of the
nation. It does not hope, as Harriet Martineau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
suggested during her visit here, ever
to become the home of the country's capital,
but it rejoices in being the great city nearest
the American centre of population. Its library
of a quarter of a million volumes and its Historical
Society cherish the splendid stories of
its past and the accumulating data of its current
achievements. Its artists and citizens
delight in dignifying that record in bronze and
marble in the environing parks and city
squares.</p>

<p>The visitor to Cincinnati, on a clear afternoon,
should take passage on an incline road,
rise to the heights of Eden Park, and traversing
that high plateau, whose natural beauty
and landscape gardening earn for it its
name, find his way to the water tower. An
elevator lifts him five hundred feet to the
observatory platform, where with field-glasses
he may behold the splendid panorama of Cincinnati.
Far below, spanning the river over
which "a crazy craft with sails and paddles"
once ferried the people, he sees five massive
structures of steel and stone, including the
famous suspension bridge, begun in the early
part of the Civil War, and by its completion
during the stress of that conflict testifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
eloquently to the faith of its citizens that strife
was not to sever the nation, and that these
mammoth girders of steel would constitute an
important tie in the inevitable reunion of
North and South. It was of this structure
that James Parton wrote in 1867, that the
whole population of Cincinnati might get
upon it without danger of being let down into
the water. The five superb bridges in their
capacity and security afford marked contrast
to the earlier attempts to span the river which
floods swept away, including the arched structure
which went down in the torrent of 1832,
accompanied on its seaward flight by a tumbling
Methodist church which the roaring
Muskingum had added to the universal
baptism.</p>

<p>Not all of the life that now courses through
Cincinnati's streets could crowd upon its
bridges, for the people of the cities and villages
across on the Kentucky shore belong in
every commercial and social sense to Cincinnati,
and swell its population to the half-million
mark. In fact, within a radius which the
vision from this tower almost sweeps, there
are a dozen ambitious and wealthy Ohio cities,
founded by the sturdy men of the Revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
who went forth from Cincinnati and still
tributary to the parent town.</p>

<p>The traveler is surveying sacred ground.
Mount Auburn beside him marks the site
where fell a captain serving under George
Rogers Clark, one of the first of the many
brave soldiers of the American Revolution to
mingle their dust with Ohio soil, which thus
enriched has produced many Presidents and
renowned statesmen almost without number.</p>

<p>Leading away from the city the observer on
the tower sees the Miami and Erie Canal,
which, connecting Cincinnati with Toledo and
furnishing a highway by which boats could
pass from New Orleans via the Queen City
through various inland waters, finally reaching
the harbor of New York, made Cincinnati as
early as 1830 a half-way house for continental
traffic. The canal recalls that on the tow-path
the barefooted Garfield began his career.</p>

<p>While glancing at the surrounding reservoirs
from which water is forced to this tower
for the supply of the terrace-built city, the
traveler may recall the story of the eccentric
wanderer, the celebrated Cincinnati "water
witch" who with hazel or willow crook went
about from hamlet to hamlet indicating hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
springs and at whose direction, in truth, the
Queen City dug its first well.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_125.jpg">RESERVOIR, EDEN PARK.</a><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></div>

<p>Descending now, the traveler may view the
observatory which John Quincy Adams dedicated
to science, or move with the crowds
flocking to the Zoo or to the groves where
free concerts are given, or he may find his
inspiration in roaming through the haunts that
still treasure the memory of U.S. Grant, or
visit the site of taverns that entertained Webster
and Andrew Jackson, who paused here
on his way to Washington, and that extended
frequent hospitality to Henry Clay, stopping
here while journeying to or from the national
capital.</p>

<p>Passing over the suspension bridge, the traveler
may let the sun go down upon his itinerary
as he stands upon the bank of the Licking,
made memorable by the vigilant canoe cruises
of Daniel Boone. Near by is the cottage
home of the Grants. Passing a Shawnee effigy
in front of a tobacconist's stand, the visitor
sees the illumination of the city beginning to
twinkle against the shadowy background.
The multi-colored lights of myriad street-cars
flash over bridges and up the steep streets of
the hill-built metropolis. The headlights of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
locomotives on nineteen railroads, representing
over twenty thousand miles of track, gleam
in and out of the city. It is a moving picture,
a perpetual memorial and celebration of the
valiant labors of those paladins of pioneer conquest
who on that Christmas week, 113 years
ago, struck their flint and started their fires in
the primeval woods, kindling thereby a light
which though flaring at times before the
whirlwinds of savage war, and all but quenched
with baptisms of fraternal bloodshed, now burns
with a steadiness and brilliancy that shall last as
long as time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span></p>

<p class="chapby">By SILAS FARMER</p>


<p>A stream of crystal clearness, wide and
swiftly flowing, the waters of silver and
blue alive with fins and scales, a course dotted
with islands large and small, wild ducks in
myriads diving and dining along shores
bordered with pond lilies and flags, stretches
of yellow sand and bluffs of yellow clay peopled
with buffalo, bear and deer, with wide
leagues of grassy pastures and pleasing vistas
beyond, walnuts, oaks and maples sentinelling
the scene, and skies and sunsets of unrivalled
azure and gold adding the final touch of
beauty&mdash;such was Nature's invitation to the
first visitors to the Detroit.</p>

<p>The earliest of the French travellers to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
region was the Sieur Joliet, who came in 1670,
and was followed the same year by the Sulpician
priests, Galinée and Dollier. Eight years
later La Salle in <i>Le Griffon</i>, the first sail-vessel
on the Great Lakes, passed through the
"strait of Lake Erie," and July 24, 1701,
Cadillac and his company landed at the present
site of Detroit to establish a fort and
permanent settlement.</p>

<p>The desire to escape from Roman or Protestant
oppression which led to the founding
of Baltimore and Plymouth had no
place in the thought of those who colonized
Acadia and the West. True, there had been
one or two feeble efforts to found French
Protestant colonies in America. The great
Coligny sent a Huguenot colony to Florida
more than fifty years before the <i>Mayflower</i>
arrived at Plymouth Rock. The Spaniards,
however, fell upon and hanged these colonists,
their placards stating that it was done, "not
because they were Frenchmen, but because
they were heretics." Under Cardinal Richelieu,
all Protestant emigration to America was
discouraged for fear the emigrants would unite
with the English or make converts of the Indians.
The conversion of the Indians to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Romish faith was always specially designated
among the objects of French enterprise in
America. The charter of the "Hundred
Associates" of April 29, 1627, expressly stated
that it was granted for the primary purpose of
converting to the Catholic faith the Indians,
usually designated as "worshippers of Baal."
All these motives played their part in the
founding of Detroit, but not quite so important
a part as the commercial motive.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_131.jpg">CADILLAC SQUARE, SHOWING CITY HALL AND MAJESTIC BUILDING.</a><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></div>

<p>Antoine Laumet de la Mothe Cadillac, the
founder and commandant, was no mere adventurer.
In courage, in scholarship, in mental
grasp and in general acumen he deserves a
place with the founders of Baltimore and
Philadelphia. The confessedly fictitious description
of his personal appearance and the
one-sided analysis of his character by Gayarré
were founded on incomplete knowledge. As
an officer of the French marine, Cadillac fearlessly
crossed the Atlantic again and again as
though it were but an inland ferry. On the
coast of America he explored the harbors and
islands of New England and noted at length
their peculiarities and advantages. As a soldier
and knight of the Order of St. Louis,
he penetrated into the wildest of western
wilds, served as commandant at Mackinaw,
Detroit and Mobile, repeatedly defeated the
Indians at these posts, and compelled them to
sue for peace. He had the scholar's habit of
writing detailed memoirs of the places he established
or was commanded to inspect. He
wielded a pen as sharp as his sharp sword.
The opponents of his plans had need to fear its
point. He spared no words. "A traveller
cannot afford to stop," he said, "for every dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that barks." And illustrating the fact that
many of the French lived so much among the
Indians that they became like Indians themselves,
he sententiously said, "With wolves
one learns to howl."</p>

<p>He denounced frauds boldly. Count Frontenac
spoke highly of his "valor, wisdom,
experience and good conduct." It was no
ordinary man to whom a wife could by word
and deed alike bear witness as Cadillac's wife
bore witness to her husband. After they had
been married for fourteen years, and when the
colony was less than two years old, in company
with Madame Touty, in an open canoe
with Indians and woodsmen for an escort, she
made the journey of a thousand miles from
Quebec to Detroit in the fall of the year when
fierce winds and rough waves and heavy rains
might be expected. When one of the Quebec
ladies reminded her in advance, "At Detroit
you will die of <i>ennui</i>," she replied, "A woman
who loves her husband as she should has no
stronger attraction than his company wherever
he may be; everything else should be indifferent
to her."</p>

<p>The American cities that equal us in age
and population are few indeed. Two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
years are behind us, and three hundred thousand
people fill our homes. Our people are
and ever have been of many types. In the
early days <i>coureurs des bois</i>, bluff, hearty, reckless,
and Indians, the squaw trudging along
bent double under her basket of bead-work,
the unburdened brave stalking proudly, noiselessly
along, frequented the place. Dutch
traders from the Mohawk coasting along the
Lakes early brought negro slaves from Albany.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
In our social life the Gallic spirit remains to
soften and harmonize. The dash of gorgeous
coloring which the almost continuous existence
here of a military post has given, the distinction
and grace which the early arrival of some
of old Virginia's noblest children has lent, the
intellectual vigor which Puritan New England
has contributed, and the solidity and conservatism
furnished by the presence of the many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
wealthy landed proprietors have all shared in
the making of a social life as rich as it is
attractive.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_135.jpg">THE DETROIT RIVER FROM "WINDMILL POINT," 1838.
FROM A PENCIL DRAWING.</a><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></div>

<p>After the first settlers came strange sights.
Round-towered and red-painted windmills began
to dot the banks of the Detroit, and all
"along shore" narrow farms, a city block in
width and fifty times as long, stretched from
the river rearward to meadows and woods.
The canoe and the pirogue were always in the
stream, and in them the French girls were as
much at home as mermaids in the sea. The
fort was the centre of every interest. It was
a log stockade enclosing a plot of ground three
or four hundred feet square, and lay south of
what is now Jefferson Avenue, occupying at
least the western half of the block between
Griswold and Shelby streets. Within it commandant
and soldiers were gathered, the
church was located, justice administered and
goods were kept on sale.</p>

<p>A large influx of immigrants, especially in
1749 and 1754, caused the extension of the
stockade, but at no time were grants of farms
made within several hundred feet of the fort.
The intervening space was in large part used
as a "common field," and year after year oats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and onions were produced where only paving-stones
could now be raised. Eventually of
course the houses overflowed the stockade,
stretching towards the farms, but for a long
time the owners of farms on either side resisted
any encroachment of streets or people, and for
many years the city could grow only northwards.
The French farms that hemmed in
the city possessed many advantages. Even
when included within the city they, for many
years, practically escaped taxation because undivided
into lots. Indeed, until a comparatively
recent period there was no taxation of
real estate and really no need for any; for
whenever the city needed money it sold a lot.
This reckless style of living continued till 1834,
the extraordinary expenses connected with the
cholera season of that year making larger taxation
needful.</p>

<p>In this connection it is well to recall an unusual
state of affairs that placed many lots
at the disposal of the city. In the year 1778,
during the Revolutionary War, the English,
to protect them against the Americans, erected
a large fort where the new Post-office is located,
in the block bounded by Shelby, Wayne,
Lafayette and Fort streets. At the close of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the war this fort, with its grounds, passed into
the possession of the United States. In 1826
Congress gave this property, worth to-day more
than a score of millions, to the city whose expenses
had before been paid by fees derived
from various licensed persons and pursuits.
Upon the reception of this property the city
fathers deemed it necessary to level and grade
the old fort and its appurtenances and to lay out
streets thereon. The cost of the work was paid
by the issuing of city "shinplasters" which
could soon be bought for sixty cents on the dollar.
The lots laid out within the limits of the old
cantonment were sold at nominal prices, the
purchasers paying for them in the depreciated
city bills. The result was that the net proceeds
to the city from the sale of this extensive
domain amounted to only $15,000, and even
this was not permanently invested, and no vestige
of the funds remains. In contrast to the
dissipation by the city of valuable property is
the wisdom displayed by individual holders
whose property later became worth millions.
If the city officers of that day had possessed
foresight as well as power, they might have so
conserved the city's possessions as to have
made Detroit an Utopia. All the public schools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and other civic buildings and appurtenances
could have been built and paid for, and the
city government could to-day be carried on
without taxation, or at least with only a tithe
of the amount that is now required to be paid.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_139.jpg">WEST GRAND CIRCUS PARK.</a><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></div>

<p>It was during the decades of 1820-1840 that
the tide of emigration from East to West
reached its height. It began in 1825, on the
completion of the Erie Canal, and was greatly
increased by the larger number of steamboats
on the Lakes that immediately followed. The
opening in 1854 of the first railroad from the
East to the West, the Great Western of Canada,
made it possible to go still faster and
with greater ease, and during the whole period
Detroit gained largely in population. The
introduction of street-cars in 1863 afforded
opportunity for easy access to outlying regions,
and since then the city limits have been several
times extended, until now they embrace
an area of not far from thirty square miles,
with a river frontage of seven miles.</p>

<p>Contemporaneously with the rush of settlers
to the State and city between 1830 and 1840,
came what is known as the "flush times of
1837." Emigration to the West had become
almost a stampede, both steam and sail vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
were crowded to their utmost, and knowing
the dearness of Eastern lands and the cheapness
at which Western lands could be purchased,
nearly every person came prepared to
buy and did buy lands for settlement or speculation.
So great was the rush that all careful
preliminaries were dispensed with, and if only
a title could be shown, anything that "lay
outdoors" could be disposed of. Town
sites were a favorite form of investment, and
the supply kept pace with the demand. Surveyors
and draftsmen were soon busy day and
night representing imaginary cities on paper.
On these plans, literally like "Jonah's gourd,"
there sprang up in a night, stores, dwellings
and court-houses, indeed, all the appurtenances
of an old established town. The era of
"wildcat" banks had just begun and the
principal security of their bills was the land
covered by these imaginary towns. Theoretically,
twenty per cent of the bills issued by
the too easily organized banks were to be secured
by specie deposits. Actually, not five
per cent was so deposited. The same coin&mdash;in
some cases in the same boxes&mdash;was exhibited
by a score of different banks, and in some instances
"coin boxes" were filled with iron and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
other substitutes for specie. These frauds
were winked at by bank commissioners, who
should have inspected the contents of the
boxes. There was thus a trinity of imaginings,&mdash;imaginary
towns, imaginary banks and
imaginary inspection. When the bubbles
burst there were left in some places towns and
houses without a single inhabitant, and certain
of these houses contained room after room in
which the walls were literally papered with
bank bills in sheets that had never been cut
apart or signed.</p>

<p>The most important local event was the fire
of June 11, 1805, which destroyed every house
in the city save one. The memory of the fire
is preserved in the present seal of the city,
the mottoes, <i>Resurget Cineribus</i>, "She has
risen from the ashes," and <i>Speramus Meliora</i>,
"We hope for better things," representing
both prophecy and fulfilment. Out of the
fire grew an entirely new plan of the town,
new lot alignments and assignments, and a
new form of government. The former streets,
twelve feet wide, grew into broad avenues, and
the years have added areas and improvements
which in any city would be marks of prosperity
and beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The form of government which the fire introduced
was, however, its unique result. The
beginnings of the strange methods of government
that obtained are found in the organization
of the Ohio Company, and in that notable
document, the Ordinance of 1787. Under the
latter, Congress was to appoint a governor
whose term was for three years, unless sooner
revoked, who was required to possess in freehold
an estate of one thousand acres in the
territory; a secretary for the term of four
years, unless revoked, who was required to
have five hundred acres of land; and three
judges, any two of whom constituted a court
to have common-law jurisdiction, and each of
whom was required to own five hundred acres
of land.</p>

<p>The governor and judges were appointed
January 11, 1805. Judges Woodward and
Bates arrived at Detroit June 12th, and found
the town wiped out by the fire of the previous
day. A few stone chimneys and, near the fire
line, several antique pear trees alone remained.
Governor Hull arrived on the evening of July
1st. The date of the arrival of Judge Griffin is
unknown. In many respects the Governor
and judges were well fitted to enter upon and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
complete the laying out of a new Detroit.
Judge Woodward came from Alexandria, Va.,
and understood and admired the plan of Washington,
then new. He manifestly desired and
determined that Detroit should be modelled
after that "City of Magnificent Distances."
Sections of his plan as drawn by A.F. Hull,
the son of the Governor, could be laid upon
the plan of Washington and matched to a line.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_145.jpg">WAYNE COUNTY BUILDING, FACING CADILLAC SQUARE.</a><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></div>

<p>There was much delay in adopting the plan;
but after summering and wintering as best they
could, however, among their friends outside,
the inhabitants were gratified with the news
that April 21, 1806, Congress had authorized
the Governor and judges to lay out a new
town, build a court-house and jail, dispose of
ten thousand acres near, give former owners
and householders lots, convey lots to others
and in general settle all details therewith connected.
It was not, however, until September
6, 1806, or four months after the date
of the act, that the Governor and judges
held their first meeting. Interminable slowness
seems to have been their purpose;
plans and counter-plans, change and repeated
change in surveys, their method. Lots were
numbered and renumbered, streets laid out
on paper, obliterated and then laid out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
anew in new directions and locations. Decisions
were bandied about and referred from
one person or authority to another, and questions
of ownership of lots, like a shuttlecock,
were tossed to and fro. Plans were prepared,
approved, used and then discarded. Every
new difficulty and scheme seemed to give rise
to new and radically different lot outlines and
numbers. Lots were capriciously granted
and as capriciously withdrawn. Without
bond or books of account, without method
other than the method of not leaving any
record of what moneys were received or how
expended, they did as they pleased. As a
result, for a year and a half after the fire there
was not a single house erected, and up to
May, 1807, deeds had been given for only
nineteen lots. Meantime, the débris of the
fire covered the site of the ancient village, the
blackened stone chimneys standing as monuments
of the disaster and of the incompetency
or worse of those in authority.</p>

<p>The three judges and the Governor in
themselves possessed all power, legislative,
executive, judicial. They made laws, built
court-houses, issued scrip, laid out streets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
lots, gave away lots to churches, schools, societies
and individuals and were practically
"Lords of the Manor of Detroit." The
adoption of laws from the original thirteen
States, which was all that they were authorized
to do, became under their methods a mere
burlesque. A writer of that period openly
charged, and exaggerated but little in saying,
that they would</p>

<blockquote><p>"parade the laws of the original States before them
on the table, and cull letters from the laws of Maryland,
syllables from the laws of Virginia, words from
the laws of New York, sentences from the laws of
Pennsylvania, verses from the laws of Kentucky, and
chapters from the laws of Connecticut."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is due to one or two of those associated
as judges during a part of this régime, to say
that Judge Woodward, who was in office for
the entire period, was very largely responsible
for the conditions that existed. The accession
of General Cass as Governor, the establishing
of the <i>Detroit Gazette</i>, which exposed the proceedings,
and the coming of new immigrants
finally secured sentiment and people sufficient
to have a General Assembly. And with freer
discussion and elective methods, order began
to reign after twenty years of disorder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>In military matters Detroit has had an
almost continuous series of startling experiences.
Indians, French, English, and Americans
have all struggled in and about the city.
Blockhouses, stockades, forts, and cannon have
defended it. Stories of attacks, sieges, battles,
massacres, and conspiracies crowd its annals.
The tramp of regiments, the challenge of sentinels,
the bugle-call, the drum-beat, and the
war-whoop of the savage were familiar sounds
in its past.</p>

<p>Within two years after Fort Pontchartrain
was erected, hostile Indians surrounded the
stockade, and at varying intervals during many
subsequent years the savages sought to dislodge
the French and destroy their fortifications.
The French traders, however, soon
demonstrated that they were willing to deal
more liberally than the English, and there can
be no doubt but that many Indians came to
prefer French methods and manners, for they
finally united with the French during the French
and Indian War in attacking the English
settlements. The victory of Wolfe at Quebec
in 1759 and the consequent surrender of Detroit
to the English did not please the Indians,
and before the final treaty of peace was signed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Pontiac, an Ottawa chief, who had declared
his intention to "stand in the path," formed
his conspiracy to overthrow all the English
posts. He secured the co-operation of a number
of tribes and in May, 1763, prepared
to strike at Detroit. Fortunately, as has
happened more than once in similar plots, female
sympathy and tenderness caused the revelation
of his design. An Indian maiden gave
warning to Gladwin, then commanding at Detroit,
who made preparations to foil the
conspirators. On the morning of May 7th,
Pontiac and a number of his warriors sought
admission to the fort.</p>

<p>On arriving at the gateway,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Pontiac and his
warriors were freely admitted, but found the
garrison under arms, the cannons loaded for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
service and the inhabitants ready for battle.
At a glance he foresaw the certain failure of
his scheme, and after being warned by Gladwin
that his plot had been discovered, he retired
still protesting friendship. Within a day
or two afterwards he threw off all attempts at
concealment, summoned his warriors, massacred
several persons on the island now known as
Belle Isle and commenced a siege which lasted
for five weary months. During the siege, the
garrison was relieved several times by provisions
and ammunition from Niagara, and on July 29th,
by the arrival of 280 soldiers commanded by
Captain Dalyell together with 20 rangers from
New Hampshire under Major Robert Rogers.
Captain Dalyell now determined to "turn the
tables" by an attack on the Indians. Gladwin
opposed the idea, but was compelled to yield,
and on July 31st 250 troops in three detachments
marched against the savages. Pontiac in
some way was informed of the plan and, ambushed
on the border of Parents' Creek, afterwards
called Bloody Run, awaited the approach
of the soldiers. As the latter reached a small
bridge that then crossed the stream not far from
what is now the corner of Jefferson Avenue and
Adair Street, they heard the war-whoop of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Indians and from every side bullets thinned
their ranks. Dalyell and seventeen others were
killed, nearly forty soldiers wounded and several
captured. Within six hours after this
ignominious failure, the rest were glad to be
within the shelter of the stockade.</p>

<p>The siege was then renewed with increased
vigor until at last General Gage of Boston
determined to send a force large enough to subdue
the Indians. Accordingly, Colonel Bradstreet
was put in command of a combined force
of 100 friendly Indians, 900 Canadians, and a detachment
of 219 Connecticut militia in charge
of the noted Israel Putnam. They came by water
from Albany and reached Detroit on August
26, 1764. Their bateaux and barges blocked
the river; the display of flags and force alarmed
the Indians, and made them yield before an
army such as they had never seen before.</p>

<p>Meantime the war-clouds of the Revolution
were gathering. The common impression is
that the war was fought in the East, around
Boston and New York. The important
events that occurred at Detroit are usually
ignored; that, too, in spite of the fact that at
no other point was so much use made of the
Indians by the English.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>King George and his ministers evidently
feared that, unless kept busy defending their
homes, the hardy settlers of Western Virginia
and Tennessee would aid their brother colonists
in the East. In order to prevent them
from so doing, deliberate and pitiless plans
were made to incite the Indians against the
western settlers. Indians were invited to Detroit
from as far west and south as Arkansas,
and gathered here by thousands. They were
feasted, clothed and furnished with guns, scalping-knives,
and tomahawks. Blankets, shirts,
scarlet cloth and other things were given.
The value of the requisitions for this post in a
single year reached hundreds of thousands of
dollars. The writer has personally seen the
original record of the supplying of "sixteen
gross of red-handled scalping-knives." Fully
equipped, they set forth on their forays, returning
with men, women, and children as
prisoners, and with many scalps. The expedition
which perpetrated the "Massacre of
Wyoming" was equipped at this post, as was
also the expedition of Captain Bird against
Kentucky at a cost of over $300,000. The
writer has an original account book of that
period giving the names and pay per diem of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the French who as guides and interpreters
accompanied the English and Indians on some
of their raids. The noted Daniel Boone was
brought as a prisoner to Detroit after one of
these expeditions. After the return of each party
the guns of the fort were fired, the prisoners and
scalps were counted and recorded, and again
the Indians were feasted and given presents.</p>

<p>It was during these days that Col. A.S. De
Peyster was in command at Detroit, but he
was not in full sympathy with such savage
warfare. It will be remembered that it was to
him that Burns, while in his sick-chamber,
dedicated his last poem, on "Life," beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ni">"My honored Colonel, deep I feel</span>
<span class="ni">Your interest in the poet's weal," etc.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>De Peyster himself could turn a bit of society
verse. On one occasion he addressed the
following lines to the wife of Lieutenant Pool
England, then at Detroit:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ni">"Accept, fair Ann, I do beseech,</span>
<span class="ni">This tempting gift, a clingstone peach,</span>
<span class="ni">The finest fruit I culled from three,</span>
<span class="ni">Which you may safely take from me.</span>
<span class="ni">Should Pool request to share the favor,</span>
<span class="ni">Eat you the peach, give him the flavor;</span>
<span class="ni">Which surely he can't take amiss,</span>
<span class="ni">When 't is so heightened by your kiss."</span>
</div></div></div>

<span class="caption">COL. ARENT SCHUYLER DE PEYSTER.</span>
</div>

<p>The English officers then at Detroit did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
have an easy life. There were resident rebel
Americans who made much trouble&mdash;some
of whom were
sent away and
others fined.
American prisoners,
too, were
brought here.
Some were compelled
to work
in the streets, in
ball and chain,
and others were
forced to cut
wood on Belle
Isle.</p>

<p>At last Detroit
and the West
were yielded by treaty to the United States,
but on one pretext or another they were not
actually surrendered until July 11, 1796. On
that day Fort Lernoult for the first time displayed
the Stars and Stripes.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_155.jpg">EVACUATION DAY TABLET ON FORT STREET ENTRANCE OF POST-OFFICE.</a><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></div>

<p>The animosities growing out of the Revolutionary
War were not allayed by the peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
declarations. The Indians continued to hold
allegiance to King George, and frequently
massacred Americans. British officials on
various occasions assumed such authority that
at last there came a renewal of strife and the
War of 1812. Again Detroit became a focal
point. Twelve hundred troops from Ohio,
under command of Governor Hull, were soon
marching hither to secure the safety of Detroit.
Governor Hull's trunk, containing military
papers and plans of great value, which
had been sent by boat, was captured near
Malden, Canada, by the British who had apparently
received the earliest announcement of
the declaration of war. Governor Hull arrived
at Detroit July 5th, soon afterward crossed to
Canada and issued a proclamation, but a few
days later returned without having accomplished
any results of value. On August 16th,
without any reasonable excuse, and without
the firing of a single gun, he surrendered his
entire force and all of the territory under his
control to General Brock. He was tried and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
found guilty of cowardice, unofficer-like conduct
and neglect of duty. In his memoirs,
Governor Hull, trying to defend himself,
seeks to make Secretary of War Eustis a fool
or a traitor, Gen. H.A. Dearborn a knave,
and Colonel Cass a conspirator. Original
letters and testimony, however, from President
Madison, ex-President Jefferson, and Secretary
of State John Quincy Adams show that Governor
Hull was justly condemned. On September
29, 1813, as the result of Commodore
Perry's notable victory of September 10th, the
whole region was restored to American control.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_157.jpg">GENERAL GRANT'S HOME IN DETROIT.</a><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></div>

<p>Detroit's interest in several local and subsequent
wars was large, but the unimportance
of some and the well-known results of others
make comment thereon unnecessary.</p>

<p>While these varied historical events were
taking place, the city was steadily gathering to
itself prestige and reputation. Its houses now
excel in number and beauty, its streets, wide and
well paved, are edged with the smoothest of
stone walks and lined with elms, maples, and
grassy lawns. The distinctive buildings of the
municipality, its court-houses, schools, police
stations, water-works, and engine houses are
remarkable for their excellent architecture and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
well-kept condition. The churches, by their
number and in their construction, indicate the
possession of religious desire and æsthetic
taste. The manufacturing interests of Detroit
are varied. Its commercial representatives
are found in almost every country, and "Detroit"
stoves, drugs, and chemicals are known
in every clime. We have numerous parks, but
Belle Isle is indeed the priceless jewel in the
crown of Detroit: woods of green and waters
of blue, art and nature, moving waves and
waving grass, stillness and activity, vistas
and broad views, beautiful flowers and lofty
trees, the white sails of numerous vessels,
and the swift motions of great steamers all
alike are combined in the captivating beauties
of this favored place.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_159.jpg">HURLBUT MEMORIAL GATE ENTRANCE TO WATER-WORKS PARK.</a><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></div>

<p>Besides serving as a charm to drive away
care, our beautiful river gives us one of the
greatest ports in the world. More tonnage
passes annually through "the Detroit" than
in the same time enters and clears the combined
ports of London and Liverpool. During
the season nearly four hundred vessels pass
daily, bearing more grain and minerals than
traverse any other stream in the world. The
city is a central starting-point for reaching all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
northern summer resorts, and more steamboat
passengers arrive and depart from our wharves
than from any others on the Lakes. The
stream that attracted the earliest visitors attracts
later ones as well. The river never overflows
and therefore is never a menace, but
always a joy and blessing. Yachts, sail-boats,
barges, shells, ferries, steamers, and great
"whale-backs" fly and ply over it, and in the
season it is a panorama of beauty, gay with
music, streamers, and happy <i>voyageurs</i>.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="first">A</span>T the northernmost point of the meeting

<p>An old writer says that there are two-and-thirty
thousand of them, great and small,
clustered chiefly where Huron leans her head
to meet those of Michigan and Superior, "as
if they were discussing some great matter."
Perhaps they are talking over the old days and
the things and people they knew long ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Perhaps they speak of the morning when, according
to an old saga, the worshippers of the
Rising Sun in February saw the Island like a
great turtle&mdash;<i>Nocchenemockenung</i>&mdash;rise slowly
out of the water, to become the home of the
Giant Fairies of the Michsawgyegan, or Lake
Country, and to be a place of refuge for the
vanished peoples, whose names are as the
sound of many waters for beauty and for harmony.
Perhaps they tell of the wild, free life
of those roving, painted bands of fishers, trappers,
and hunters which make pictures of so
much action and color against the ever-shifting
background of these seas and shores. Perhaps
they tell of the coming of the Black Robes
in the days when the lilies of France had no
fear of the lion of England, and the eagle of
the American Republic was as yet unthought

<p>Occupying as it does, one of the most important
strategic points in the new world, it is
not strange that the Island of Mackinac should
have a rich and varied history, and that in its
earlier Indian-French form "Michilimackinac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
was a word familiar in the cabinets of European
monarchs before it was known to people dwelling
along the Atlantic." The name was given
not only to pioneer settlements on either side
of the Straits, but also to a vast province
which reached as far south as the Ohio River
and as far west as the Red River of the North.
The Straits are but a dozen miles in width, and
the Island but nine miles in circumference, but
whether it be frozen in the long clasp of
"Peboan, the Winter," when the white, endless
snows are marked only by the dark accents of
evergreens on islet and mainland, over which
the cold stars look down, or the Northern
Lights flame and fade; whether it be decked
with the unspeakable splendors of its early
autumn, or rejoices with the sudden coming of
its tardy summer, it is a land whose beauty is
indescribable, and whose spell is supreme.</p>

<p>The village numbers many thousand flitting
folk in summer, but it has less than eight hundred
permanent residents. It lies along the
perfect crescent of a bay worn into the southeastern
end of the Island, at the foot of the
cliffs, upon which the long lines of the fort
stand sentinel, and is a curious conglomeration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of huge caravanserai, summer villa, shop,
fish-house, pier, half-French, half-Indian cottage,
and church. Old days and new meet
over and over again in the little streets, where,
in the soft <i>patois</i> of the <i>habitants</i>, in the names
they bear, and in many of their strongly
marked faces, much of the Island's story is
suggested. St. Ann's is a true daughter of
the first chapels built by the old heroes of the
Church. The Mission House tells of the
earnest early efforts to teach the tenets and
virtues of Calvinism to the savages, made by
the reverend geographer, Morse, father of
Morse of the electric telegraph, and Mr.
Ferry, whose son, born in the village, ably
represented Michigan in the Senate of the
United States.</p>

<p>Where the fort garden now stands once
stood the agency, then the centre of the vast
trade of the fur companies. Within its walls
Henry Schoolcraft wrote down the precious
results of his studies in Indian dialect and
folk-lore, from which, as from a root, sprang
the perfect flower of our one native epic,
<i>Hiawatha</i>. Not to have read <i>Hiawatha</i> with
the pine-spiced winds of the north blowing
upon the page, with the magnificent prospect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of the Straits before one's eyes, lifted while
a page is turned, and with the waves breaking
into a thousand jewels against the rocks at
one's feet, is hardly to have read <i>Hiawatha</i>
at all.</p>

<p>The Fort is the successor of the feeble
early posts set up by the pioneers of France.
The great propellers and the swift-winged
yachts that throng the summer waters are of
a kindred with the birch canoe, most poetic of
all water craft&mdash;own brother to the violin by
reason of the perfect beauty of its lines,
having in it</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<span class="ni">"All the mystery and magic"</span>

<p>of the woodland and the wood life. As of
old, the deep wild roses and the frail harebells
cling to the cliffs; as of old, in the gorges
hushed into fragrant silence by pine and
larch and hemlock, arbor-vitæ and juniper,
beech, and birch, the shy, delicate flora
of the north finds shelter. As of old, the
winds try their strength against the splendid
masonry of the curious limestone formations
for which the place is noted, the Arch Rock,
the Fairy Arch, the Chimney Rock, the Sugar
Loaf, Scott's Cave, Skull Cave, the Devil's
Kitchen. Around each of these the legends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
cluster like bees about a linden-tree in blossom,
but how can they be forgiven whose crass
stupidity gave them these commonplace titles
and who have lost for us their Indian names?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_169.jpg">ARCH ROCK, MACKINAC ISLAND.</a><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></div>

<p>In the days when New France "had two
fountain heads, one in the cane brakes of
Louisiana, and the other in the snows of
Canada," a charter was given by Louis XIII.
to the Hundred Association Company, which
was thereby invested with rights almost monarchical,
together with injunctions to do all
that was possible for Holy Church which was
consistent with the keeping of a watchful
eye upon such earthly advantages as might
accrue from a monopoly of the fur trade and
the acquisition of new territory. It was in
1634, under the governorship of Champlain,
that Jean Nicolet, a fearless explorer, well
versed in woodcraft and in the speech of many
aboriginal tribes, was the first paleface to see
the white cliffs of Mackinac, as he was also the
first to carry back to civilization tidings of a
great new sea, the Lac des Ilinese, or Michigan,
which he had discovered. That he perished
by the capsizing of his canoe in the St.
Lawrence River was a great loss to the infant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
colonies to whom his sixteen years' experience
in frontier life would have been very valuable.
The path he opened, was, however, soon followed
by others. The explorers and traders,
Des Grosselliers, Radisson, Perrot, and their
fellows did for the world what the Jesuits, the
Recollets, and the Sulpicians did for the
Church. It is in the <i>Relations</i> sent home by
the priests that we learn what were the trials
overcome by those dauntless sons of "the
sturdy North." Perhaps from no country but
France, and in no other years than the glittering,
romantic, covetous, daring, devoted years
of the seventeenth century, could have come
adventurers so tireless and churchmen so selfless
as these. To read their simple, patient
chronicles is to have new belief in man, new
faith in the Church Universal, "which is
the blessed company of all faithful people,"
and to clasp hands across years and above
creeds with those courageous pioneers and
with those humble saints.</p>

<p>The story of Mackinac is for many years
the story of the French in Canada. "Not a
cape was turned," says Parkman, "not a river
was entered, but a Jesuit led the way." Every
year the establishment of new posts pushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the realms of the Unknown Territory nearer
and nearer to the sunset. Poor little posts
they were, slenderly garrisoned, and feebly
armed, but beside each one rose a chapel and
a cross where the "bloody salvages" might
learn, if they would, the religion of the fathers.
The missionaries made, perhaps, but few converts
to their faith, but they made many friends
for their country by their kindly offices to the
sick, the aged, the dying, and the infant, by
the gentleness and urbanity of their high
breeding, and by the perpetual sacrifice of
their lives of love and loyalty. Of their hardships
we can only read between the lines of
their brave, uncomplaining <i>Relations</i>, but what
litanies of pain, sorrow, and disappointment,
what <i>Te Deums</i> of hope and rejoicing lie in
these marks, oft recurring on their queer old
maps:</p>

<p>By 1668 many missions were strung along the
waterways. The Island was the centre of a
thriving trade, had thirty native villages, and
a palisaded enclosure for defence, and a year
later its shores were hallowed by the feet of
"The Guardian Angel of the Ottawa Mission,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Father Jacques Marquette.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_173.jpg">SUGAR LOAF ROCK, MACKINAC ISLAND.</a><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></div>

<p>Here, in what he called "the home of the
fishes," and "the playground of all the winds
of heaven," he spent the hard winter of
1669-70, going later to the first Fort Michilimackinac,
at St. Ignace, where he built a log-and-bark
chapel, and whence he wrote the
letters which reflect his pure spirit, as a clear
pool reflects a star. Ever alert, ever anxious,
"<i>Ad Majoram Gloriam Dei</i>," to hear of new
countries to be brought to Him, his great
opportunity came when the tribes trooped
past the Island on their way to the Sault Ste.
Marie and the Great Congress, convened on
the 14th of June, 1671, by the hardy Perrot.
The French wanted to control the frontier
trade; the Indians wished a market for their
furs. To both peoples pomp and ceremony
were natural and dear, so here, in all the
splendor of war-paint and wampum, tomahawk,
calumet, feathers, bows and arrows, and handsome
furs came the braves of many tribes; in
all the gay accoutrement of blanket-surtout,
scarlet cap, fringed elk-skin leggins, rifle, and
dagger-decked sash came the <i>coureurs des
bois</i> and the <i>voyageurs</i>; in the dignity of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
uniforms came a handful of soldiers; with cross
and cassock came the priests, to gather under
a great wooden cross, to which the arms of
France had been nailed, where, by a <i>procès
verbal</i>, the overlordship of the Great West
was assumed by Louis XIV.</p>

<p>Among the representatives of so many scattered
savages, Father Marquette doubtless
made the inquiries about and gained the knowledge
concerning the Great Unknown River
which served him in such good stead when, on
the 17th of May, 1673, he started with Louis
Joliet, five <i>voyageurs</i>, and in two canoes, on
the voyage which made the Mississippi known
to Europe. Of the honor coming from the
discovery the good father never thought, but
only with joy of new lands to which the message
of the Cross could be carried. It is the
story of a hero, the story of his short life and
of his triumphant death, "alone, a Jesuit, and
a Missionary," beside an obscure creek on the
Michigan shore, on the 19th of May, 1675, in
the eight-and-thirtieth year of his age. Descendants
of his Ottawas and his Hurons still
tell of his "bright hair, like the sun," and of
the great funeral when, two years after his
death, his body was brought back to St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Ignace. Whether the dust now held sacred
was his or no, is of little moment. In the
Book of Life, above and below, the name of
Jacques Marquette has long been written, and
like the blessing of peace his spirit rests upon
the Northland.</p>

<p>In 1679, the <i>Griffin</i>, a little ship of sixty
tons, took Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle,
and the garrulous, mendacious Recollet friar,
Hennepin, past the Island on their way to the
Great River, which they were to explore to the
Gulf, and beside which the murdered body of
the great Norman was to be flung. He only
touched the Island, but the touch of La Salle
was a royal accolade.</p>

<p>In 1688, La Honton, a soldier of unusual
sagacity, noted the importance of the site, and
in 1695 M. de la Motte Cadillac says that the
fort, with its garrison of two hundred soldiers,
and the village of Canadians and Indians
to the number of six or seven thousand
souls, made it one of the largest posts in Canada.
Disputes between the commandant and
the Jesuits, chiefly about the sale of liquor to
the Indians, resulted in the discouragement
of the priests, who, in 1705, burned their chapel
and their school, and went back to Quebec.
St. Ignace was then gradually abandoned for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
a second Michilimackinac on the southern
peninsula.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_177.jpg">THE OLD BLOCKHOUSE (1780) OVERLOOKING THE LAKE.</a><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></div>

<p>When the French and English war was
ended on the Plains of Abraham, George III.
became indeed sovereign of the soil of Canada,
but Louis XV. was lord of the hearts of too
many French, half-breeds, and Indians to make
the transfer of allegiance easy. Loves and
hates and racial sympathies are not matters
for cold diplomacy, and the people of the
Northwest waited longingly for a leader who
should give them again the light-hearted,
friendly rule of the French, under which they
had been far happier than they found themselves
as subjects of the stern, alien English.
In the person of an Ottawa chieftain, the
most remarkable personage produced by the
Indian race, the leader was found. In
the brain of Pontiac, grim, far-seeing, fearless,
heroic, there arose as a prophetic vision the
assurance that English encroachments upon
the rights of his people would never cease so
long as they held a rod of ground coveted by
an English eye. To avert the evils he foresaw,
he planned the capture of all forts west of
Niagara, the extermination of all English
settlers, and the restoration to the Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Father at Versailles of the lands he had
just lost. With incredible swiftness he formed
the vast conspiracy whose story has been told,
once for all, in the living pages of Parkman's
narrative.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_179.jpg">"OLD STONE QUARTERS," FORT MACKINAC, 1780.</a><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></div>

<p>Whisperings of coming trouble had been
heard at Fort Michilimackinac by Major Etherington,
the commandant, but none of so serious
a nature as to prevent the presence of the
soldiery at a great game of baggatiway which
was to be played in a field near the fort by
rival companies of Sacs and Chippewas, in
honor of the King's birthday, August 4, 1763.
The game is a very intricate and brilliant one,
requiring great agility and skill, and the participation
of a large number of players. As
was most natural, the excitement of the onlookers
was intense, and when an apparently
stray ball flew high over the palisades of the
unprotected fort (which had been silently
invaded by a crowd of squaws with weapons hidden
under their blankets) and at least four hundred
players in hot pursuit swarmed over the
stockade, nothing was thought amiss, until the
cries appropriate to the game changed into
the war-whoop, and a massacre began. Of
the English, all were either killed or made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
captive, except Alexander Henry, whose narrative
curdles the blood even yet.</p>

of the Indians&mdash;was kept up by the British until
1774; between that date and 1780 the flag was transferred
... the principal trade went with it, the Indian
intercourse likewise. Some residents lingered a few
years but the place was finally abandoned, and the site
is now covered with loose sand."</p></blockquote>

<p>By the Treaty of Paris, in 1783, the Island
was ceded by Great Britain to the United
States. Possession was, however, withheld
on one pretext or another, until 1796.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_183.jpg">FORT MACKINAC, AND THE CANNON CAPTURED BY COMMODORE PERRY.</a></div>

<p>When the second war with England began,
it was natural that one of the first points to be
attacked should be the fort so commandingly
situated. Far from all base of supplies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
all possibility of rapid communication, the oft-repeated
appeals of General Hull for an effective
garrison at this and other important points
were totally disregarded in Washington. Only
fifty-seven soldiers were in residence in Mackinac
when the British forces, 1021 strong, landed
before dawn on the 17th of July, 1812, on a point
nearly opposite St. Ignace. By eleven o'clock
Captain Roberts sent a flag of truce, and a demand
of surrender to Lieutenant Porter
Hanks, who had had "no intimation" that a
war between the powers had been declared
until that moment. After considering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
futility of resistance, and a consultation with
the American traders in the village, with the
valor which was ever bettered by discretion,
he capitulated.</p>

<p>In August, 1814, an attempt was made to
retake the Island. A battle was fought near
the scene of the British landing two years before,
in which battle Major Holmes and twelve
privates were killed, and many men were
wounded or missing. The routed Americans,
under Colonel Croghan, withdrew to their
ships. The Island finally passed into the
keeping of the United States in 1815.</p>

<p>Then followed the great days of the fur
companies, when the place was astir with a
life so gay and vivid that only to hear of it stirs
the blood of the untamed savage which centuries
of the repressions of civilization have not
routed from our hearts. Hundreds of hardy,
ill-paid <i>engagés</i>, hundreds of happy-go-lucky,
hard-working <i>voyageurs</i> and <i>coureurs des bois</i>
and hundreds of Indians crowded into the hundreds
of tents set up along the beach; into the
log-houses of the primitive village, and into
the huge barracks of the company, which
counted and weighed the rich peltries they had
gathered, paying them in return the miserable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
wages which in dancing, gambling, drinking,

<p>An incident but little known connects the
Island with one of the great mysteries of history,&mdash;the
fate of the little son of Louis
XVI. and Marie Antoinette. That the
Dauphin did not die in the Temple, but had
been secretly conveyed to America and had
been placed among the Indians, was believed
by persons whose opinions were entitled to respect;
but that he might be found in the person
of the Rev. Eleazar Williams, a half-breed
missionary of the Protestant Episcopal Church
among the tribes about Green Bay, was a supposition
stranger than any fiction. The story
is too long to tell here,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> but as it touches
Mackinac at a single point, it must have a
line in this chapter.</p>

<p>On the wharf of the moon-shaped bay, one
bright day in October, 1841, a crowd was
gathered to see the Prince de Joinville, son of
Louis Philippe, then reigning in France, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
was on his way to Green Bay, and who had
stopped off at Mackinac to visit some of the
natural curiosities of the place. A salute had
been fired in honor of the royal sailor with
true republican fervor, and while the steamer
which had brought him waited his pleasure,
the village was <i>en fête</i>. Waiting on the dock,
and also about to embark for Green Bay, was
the Rev. Eleazar Williams, who, before
the boat left the bay, was, at the request of the
Prince, presented to his Highness. The
acquaintance thus begun led to disclosures
which, if true, make the identity of the Dauphin
and the missionary all but certain.</p>

<p>Wrapped in a legend, the Island of Mackinac
comes into sight. With a thousand legends,
its old fields, its cliffs, its caves, its gorges, its
wooded glens, its shores, and its far, dim distances
are haunted. With a thousand mysteries
and bewilderments and witcheries it
holds captive all who come within reach of its
magic. With a mystery, which too may be
but a legend, our story closes, as the light that
smites the waters of the Straits into a myriad
of glittering flakes paints on the sunset sky the
old, old golden track which the Indians loved
to call "the Path that leads Homeward."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<h2>INDIANAPOLIS<br />

THE HOOSIER CAPITAL</h2>

<p class="chapby">By PERRY S. HEATH</p>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">T</span>HE visitor to the Hoosier capital familiar
with the capital of the nation instantly
observes a striking similarity between the two.
Well he may, for Alexander Ralston, who
carried the chains for Pierre Charles L'Enfant,
and placed the stakes which fixed the lines
and curves of the City of Magnificent Distances,
was the surveyor of Indianapolis.
When, in 1821, he carved out of the small
cleared space in the centre of a great wilderness
the plan just one mile square for Indianapolis,
his architectural abilities and ambitions
had more than a superficial justification. The
result was perhaps the handsomest city between
Philadelphia and Denver.</p>

<p>When Indianapolis was platted on the surveyor's
map it had but 800 inhabitants. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the year 1840 the town had grown to 2672
inhabitants. There were only 48,244 souls in
the city in 1870. But by 1890 the population
had increased to 105,436, and the census of
1900 placed the population at 169,164. In
the latter decade Indianapolis outstripped
Rochester, New York, St. Paul, Minneapolis,
Kansas City, Denver, and Omaha in increase
of population. And the area occupied by the
city grew in three quarters of a century from
one to twenty-seven square miles.</p>

<p>Entering Indianapolis to-day upon any one
of the seventeen independent railroads operated
by steam locomotives, or any one of the
many interurban electric systems, the traveller
is entranced, in passing the wide, asphalted
avenues, by the magnificent view which carries
the vision to the hub of the city, where the
eye readily perceives the panorama of the
State House, four or five magnificent hotels,
some majestic club-houses, and the world-famed
Soldiers' Monument in the Governor's
Circle. The city is not one over which dense
clouds of smoke hover daily, marks unmistakable
of great manufacturing interests. The
sky is usually clear. Natural gas and oil are
largely employed as fuel for the production of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
steam. Where coal is used the consumers are
largely located in the remote outskirts. During
half the year the foliage from the splendid
system of shade and other trees along the
avenues and streets and in the parks clothes
the city in a verdure producing a pleasing
effect upon the vision and the atmosphere. In
winter-time the well-paved streets and the universal
system of cement sidewalks are ever
under the enforcement of perfect city regulations,
clear of snow and sleet and other impediments
to boulevard driving and pedestrianism.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_191.jpg">OLD STATE HOUSE, INDIANAPOLIS.</a></div>

<p>There is about the history of Indianapolis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
much of quaint Indian tradition and historical
attractiveness. While almost every trace of
the rural, or the virgin forests which were in
view from any point a few years ago, has disappeared
and modern structures and improvements
abound, the visitor wherever he goes,
cannot forget, that he is in a city which made
great progress during the last half of the
nineteenth century. On every hand this fact
is illustrated. It was as late as April, 1816,
that Congress authorized the construction of a
constitution for the State. As recently as
three quarters of a century ago the White
River, on which Indianapolis is situated, was
dotted from source to mouth, with the canoes
of savages, and lined along its banks, in the
dense wilderness, with Indian villages. The
white man made his way in constant fear
through the country. It is true that Vincennes
had been settled by white people generations
before, but its citizens had at this time
few if any relations, social or commercial, with
any other section of the Territory, and everywhere
the red man continued to be a prime
factor, holding and controlling the affairs of
the domain. While the White and Wabash
rivers in the interior furnished during a part
of the year transportation by raft, the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
buffalo trail from Vincennes to the Falls of the
Ohio, cleared by immigrants, afforded the only
safe outlet or inlet, and was in consequence a
great thoroughfare. The Whetzels, known to
history as the intrepid Indian fighters, paved
the way through the Territory and made it
possible for immigrants to find Indianapolis
in its early days.</p>

<p>At the time this city was located and titled
there was so much of Indian lore in the minds
of the legislators, and in fact so much of the
red man in the wilderness around, a constant
source of apprehension, that great difficulty
was found in securing a name for the new
metropolis. Tecumseh, Suwarrow, Whetzel,
Wayne, Delaware, and other names familiar
to the paleface hunted by or hunting
the red man, were suggested. Finally Mr.
Samuel Merrill, a name significant in the
modern history of Indiana and Indianapolis,
and prominent in the upbuilding and development
of the best institutions of the State and
city, proposed indianapolis as the name for
the city which is now the pride of all Hoosier
hearts.</p>

<p>The original city was platted with streets just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
one mile in length from end to end. The
avenues, or "diagonals," as they were termed
on the original plat, radiated from the Circle
(the hub) in the centre and constituted that
beautiful design
which
makes the capital
of France
and the capital
of the United
States so attractive
in appearance,
and yet in
some respects
"a labyrinth or
mesh to the unfamiliar."
Near
the radiating
point or Circle
was early established
a market,
which is
to-day one of the great conveniences to the residents
of the city and to those who market their
products and an attraction at most seasons of
the year to visitors.</p>

<p>It was not until the removal in November,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
1824, of the archives of Indiana from Corydon
to Indianapolis, that the latter became
the actual capital. In 1827 the Legislature
appropriated four thousand dollars for a Governor's
residence to be located in the Circle.
Its construction was commenced, but never
completed. The unfurnished portion was
occupied at one time as a schoolhouse, until
finally the officers of the Supreme Court
made it their headquarters. After some years
the crude building was demolished and the
ground was converted into a park, the present
location of the Soldiers' Monument.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_197.jpg">STATE HOUSE, INDIANAPOLIS. EAST FRONT.</a><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></div>

<p>It was not until a third of the nineteenth
century had passed, not until near 1840, that
Indianapolis became more pretentious than
any other country town. The public squares
were feeding-grounds for the ox and horse
teams of countrymen who came to market.
There were practically no industries, and
the buildings were primitive and simple. As
late as 1875 the wags of the stage and the
humorists of the press amused themselves
with jeers at the Hoosier capital. The
Hoosier was a joke in the East. He was
represented as the typical raw character, greatly
in need of common advantages and ordinary
enlightenment. And the impression persisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
until some time after three quarters of the
nineteenth century had passed that Indianapolis
was simply a congregating-point for him
and his kind. About 1880 the city began
to take on the appearance of a modern ambitious
metropolis. As wealth increased the
people resorted in ever increasing numbers to
the capital, to enjoy the schools for their children
and the best civilization for themselves.
Gradually there have gathered there not only
the prosperous citizens of the State, but many
who have at home or abroad achieved renown
in letters, diplomacy, official life, the army and
navy. Here have lived two Vice-Presidents of
our country. One of our Presidents, the late
General Benjamin Harrison, lived and died
here. Dialect poets, local historians, and
novelists have spent their days here and been
the pride of their fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>In 1831 the Legislature made an appropriation
of fifty thousand dollars for the construction
of a State House. The investment,
when completed, however, aggregated about
sixty thousand dollars. And the State viewed
the result with satisfaction and believed she had
one of the most attractive and majestic State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Houses in the entire country, as indeed she had
after the substitution in 1887, at an expense of
$1,936,000, of the present magnificent structure.</p>

<p>Indianapolis has more than one hundred
church buildings. The City Hall, with a seating
capacity of over five thousand, the gift of
Mr. Daniel Tomlinson, was constructed at an
expense of $150,000, and is principally used
for conventions and musical festivals.</p>

<p>In 1836 the State began an elaborate system
of internal improvements. Railroads, canals,
and turnpikes were subsidized and encouraged
in every manner possible. The first railroad to
reach Indianapolis came up in 1847 from Madison,
on the Ohio River, creating the usual sensation
of the new railroad in those days. As
long ago as 1860 Indianapolis became the railroad
centre of the Central West. The diversified
and almost limitless products of the State,
of the farm and the mine, and the fact that Indianapolis
is in the direct pathway between the
East and the West, afforded great attraction to
railroad builders. The Union Railroad Station,
until recently the largest and best in the United
States, is still one of the most commodious,
comfortable, and beautiful in the country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>During the Civil War Indianapolis was a
storm-centre. The State was not surpassed
by any other in the percentage of soldiers
sent out to defend the Union. Here they
rendezvoused, and Camp Morton and other
points about the city for many years after
the war bore signs of the long presence
of the "Boys in Blue." Indiana possessed a
great war Governor in Oliver P. Morton, the
steadfast friend of Lincoln and a loyal anti-slavist.
For five years in Indianapolis the
shrill sound of the fife and the roll of the
drum scarcely ever ceased, day or night.
Those living to-day who recall the activities
of the days of the Civil War view the Soldiers'
Monument, in the heart of the city, and the
many evidences of reverence for the memory
of our Union soldiers in the beautiful cemeteries
without surprise. These to them are
but simple sequences, natural results.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_201.jpg">SOLDIERS' MONUMENT, INDIANAPOLIS.</a><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></div>

<p>The straggling village of the first days of
the war soon became a bustling little city.
For the first time business blocks began to appear
along the leading streets and avenues.
The architecture in the residences evinced a
tendency toward the modern as time progressed.
The corduroy or cobble streets were
improved. The heavy artillery and ponderous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
wagons carrying munitions of war required
something more substantial in heavy weather,
and gravel was thrown upon the muddy
thoroughfares. Level as a plain, but beautifully
drained by the slight inclines to the
White River, it was possible to transform those
streams of mud in winter-time and heaps of
brown dust in the dry summer into the magnificently
paved or perfectly asphalted streets
of the present day. The city now has 150
miles of improved streets&mdash;forty miles of
asphalt, costing $2,514,576; twenty-three miles
of brick, $902,276; twelve miles of wooden
block, $710,646, and seventy-five miles of
gravel and boulder, $777,306. There are 107
miles of cement sidewalks, which required an
expenditure of $552,489, and ninety-one miles
of sewers, at an outlay of $1,575,878.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_203.jpg">MARION COUNTY COURT HOUSE.</a><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></div>

<p>Many beautiful residences, surrounded by
well-kept lawns and parks, may be viewed by
a drive through the city or by a tour over
any of the lines of the splendidly managed consolidated
street-railway system. The city has
1207 acres of parks, more attractive than the
parks of Washington. Riverside Park, containing
953 acres, the ground for which was
purchased in 1900, lies along the White River.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Garfield Park contains 103 acres; Brookside
Park, eighty-one acres; and there are various
smaller parks throughout the city. The municipality
of Indianapolis has a large park fund,
created from the sale of bonds and from a tax
levied for park purposes. The financial condition
of the <ins class="corr" title='Correction: Text was "muncipality"'>municipality</ins> is the pride of the
citizens. The value of school property is
$1,993,620. The city library is a handsome
building, erected especially for library purposes,
and contains one hundred thousand volumes.</p>

<p>In 1887 the Legislature appropriated $200,000
for the erection in Governor's Circle
of the monument to the soldiers and sailors
of the State. The conerstone was laid
August 2, 1889. The monument was designed
by Bruno Schmidt, of Berlin, and was
built of Indiana limestone, at an expense of
$600,000, including the images at the base.
The monument stands 268 feet in height.
Around the approaches are eight magnificent
candelabra, valued at $40,000. The two cascades
are the largest artificial waterfalls in the
world, discharging each minute seven thousand
gallons. The water is derived from driven
wells beneath the monument, and after flowing
over the cascade returns to the reservoir, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
which it is again used through power furnished
by force pumps. In 1900 the revenue of the
city was $1,341,861, and the expenditure $1,245,000.
The bonded debt was $2,135,700.
The assessed valuation of property for 1900
was $126,672,652. There are five national
banks with a combined capital of $2,400,000,
and four trust companies with a combined
capital of $3,000,000. The wholesale trade is
extensive, confined mostly to drygoods, boots
and shoes, and hats, and reaches as far south
as Texas and west to Oklahoma.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_205.jpg">COLUMBIA CLUB, INDIANAPOLIS.</a><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></div>

<p>Manufacturing interests are large, consisting
mainly of structural iron, mill machinery, engines
and various kinds of bent-wood. It is
contended that only Cincinnati, Philadelphia,
and New York surpass Indianapolis in the
amount of many manufactured products. Mill
machinery and structural iron is shipped in
large quantities to Europe, South America, and
other foreign lands. Indianapolis is one of
the greatest horse markets in the country, and
is surpassed by only three cities as a market
for hogs and cattle. A belt railroad circles
the city, connecting the two immense stockyards
with all the steam railroads.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_207.jpg">THE HENDRICKS MONUMENT.</a><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></div>

<p>In May, 1895, John Herron willed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Art Association $200,000, with which to erect
an art gallery. A site has been purchased,
and the gallery is this year to be built. The
Commercial Club, composed of the leading
business men of the city and devoted to advancing
the interests of the city, occupies its own
building, an elegant eight-story structure. The
home for the Columbia Club, a Republican
organization of State importance, which has
just been completed at an expense of nearly
$200,000, is one of the finest club properties
in the entire West. The Marion and the University
clubs both own their buildings, and the
women, too, have a club-house. The Law
Building is a handsome and valuable structure
of twelve stories, occupied exclusively by attorneys.
The corporation has a large law library
for the use of the tenants.</p>

<p>State institutions are the Insane Hospital,
containing fifteen hundred patients; Institute
for the Education of the Blind, and a similar
institution for deaf-mutes. The city has a large
and handsomely equipped hospital, and there
are two others well appointed. A new hotel
building will this year take the place of the
Bates House, at a cost of more than $2,000,000.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
The city is adorned with impressive statues of
her favorite sons: Morton, Whitcomb, William
Henry Harrison, and George Rogers Clark in
Monument Place, Vice-President Colfax in
University Park, and Vice-President Hendricks
in the State House grounds. To these will be
added in 1901 one of General Henry W. Lawton,
a native Hoosier, who fell in battle in the
Philippines, one of General Pleasant A. Hackleman,
the only general officer from Indiana
killed in the Civil War, and one sometime, of
course, of the late ex-President Harrison.</p>

<p>Except Philadelphia, it is doubtful if there is
a city in the Union where a greater percentage
of the wage-earners possess their own homes.
Labor strikes or disturbances are here almost
unknown, and the conditions of peace and
prosperity are assured for many years to
come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<h2>VINCENNES<br />

THE KEY TO THE NORTHWEST</h2>

<p class="chapby">By WILLIAM HENRY SMITH</p>


<p class="noin"><span class="firstq">"</span><span class="first">O</span>N the banks of the Wabash" is one of
the greater historic sites of the great
Northwest. Of no great importance, at least
commercially, to-day, it was once the seat
of the empire of France in the Ohio Valley,
and long before, possibly when Moses was
leading his people out of bondage, the seat
of an empire established by a race we now
call prehistoric. When the Mound Builders
came, whence they came, when they went
away, or whither, will, in all probability never
be determined; but they were surely here,
and from the works they left behind, must
have been here for centuries, and must have
numbered millions. The site of their capital
is not known, but if it was not on the spot
where Vincennes now stands, certainly one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the most populous cities of their empire did
stand here. In the immediate vicinity are
several large mounds, and around them are
hundreds of smaller mounds.</p>

<p>There must have been something attractive
about this spot on the Wabash, for after the
Mound Builders deserted it and the red men
came to occupy the land, they, too, selected it
for the site of one of their principal towns.
No one knows what tribes have dwelt here, but
when it was first visited by white men, the
Pi-ank-a-shaws, one of the leading tribes of
the great Miami Confederacy, organized to
drive back eastward the Six Nations, occupied
it as their principal village, and called it Chip-kaw-kay.
As the red men depended upon
the forests and streams for both food and
clothing, this was for them an ideal spot.
The finest forests in America were here, filled
with buffalo, bear, deer, and other game; while
the Wabash furnished them fish and gave them
a highway easily traversed by which to visit
friends in other sections or to make raids on
hostile tribes.</p>

<p>The traditions of the Pi-ank-a-shaws indicate
that they occupied the site for more than
a century before the coming of the whites.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Just when the first white man visited the spot
cannot be determined. There is little doubt
that La Salle passed up the Wabash about
1669, gave it the name of the Ouabache, and
marked it on his maps.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Finding an Indian
town, he probably stopped and, as was his wont,
made friends with the tribes. A few years
later the town was abandoned for a while,
owing to the irruptions of the fierce Iroquois,
who were extremely hostile to the
French, and La Salle gathered all the other
Indian tribes around his fort on the Illinois,
where they remained until about 1711. When
the Iroquois retired over the mountains the
other tribes returned to their old homes; the
Pi-ank-a-shaws to their village on the Wabash,
the Weas erecting their wigwams near the
mouth of the Tippecanoe, and the twightwees
locating at the head of the Maumee.
Afterward the Delawares took up their home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in Central Indiana, the Shawnees in the eastern
portion, and the Pottawatomies around the
foot of Lake Michigan.</p>

<p>The Indians had hardly gotten back to
their old hunting-grounds before the <i>coureurs
des bois</i> began to make excursions into the
territory in search of peltries and adventures.
Some of them penetrated as far as Chip-kaw-kay
and dwelt for some time with the Pi-ank-a-shaws.
Traditions tell of the visit of a
missionary or two, but there is no certainty.</p>

<p>Rumors grew of English traders crossing
the mountains, and as all the territory from
the Alleghanies to the Mississippi was claimed
by France because of the explorations of
La Salle, the French authorities in Canada
and Louisiana became alarmed, and in 1718
sent out Jean Baptiste Bissot, the Sieur de
Vincent, from Canada to establish posts on
the Wabash. He reached Ke-ki-on-ga, the
town of the Twightwees, at the head of the
Maumee, selected it for one of his posts, and
for another, Wea town, below the mouth of
the Tippecanoe.</p>

<p>At that time not all of the Ohio Valley was
under the jurisdiction of Canada, but the
lower half of what are now Ohio, Indiana, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Illinois belonged to the province of Louisiana.
For this reason Bissot made no effort to establish
posts farther down the Wabash than Wea
town, afterward known as Ouiatenon. He
died at Ke-ki-on-ga, in 1719. The incursions
of the English growing bolder and more frequent,
M. Broisbriant, Governor of Louisiana,
about 1725, ordered François Margane, Sieur de
Vincent, who had succeeded to the title of his
uncle, Jean Baptiste Bissot, to prepare to repel
the advance of the English and drive them
back across the mountains. For this purpose
Margane established a post at Chip-kaw-kay,
and about seven years later a number of French-Canadian
families settled there. This was the
first settlement of whites in Indiana, although
trading posts had previously been established
at the head of the Maumee and at Ouiatenon.
This was the beginning of Vincennes, which
was called "the Post," "au Poste," and "Old
Post," till in 1735 it received the present name.
Margane commanded the Post until 1736,
when he joined an expedition against the Indians
on the Mississippi, and was captured and
burned at the stake.</p>

<p>After his death till the territory was ceded
in 1763 to the British, the Post was commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
by Lieutenant Louis St. Ange, who had assisted
in establishing it. The French during
this period lived in peace and friendship with
the Indians, the Pi-ank-a-shaws giving the settlers
a large tract of land around the Post for
their use. This land was held in common by
all the inhabitants. In the spring a certain portion
was allotted to the head of each family, or
to any one else willing to cultivate it, but when
the harvest was over the fences were taken
down and the land again became public property.
After the accession of St. Ange to the
command, he made to certain of the more important
persons in the little settlement individual
grants of some of this land, which later
caused great confusion.</p>

<p>Lieutenant St. Ange had much influence
with the Indians, and as the French made no
attempts to claim the lands of the Indians, or
to destroy their hunting-grounds by cutting
down the forests, the little settlement at Vincennes
lived without molestation or fear, until
about 1751, when British agents stirred up
some of the tribes to attempt the destruction
of the French posts in the Ohio Valley. St.
Ange put his post in a secure state of defence,
and although a few friendly Indians were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
killed by the hostiles in the immediate neighborhood,
the Post itself was not attacked.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_217.jpg">EARLY FRENCH SETTLERS AT VINCENNES.</a></div>

<p>When Canada was ceded to the British it
took with it the posts at the head of the Maumee
and Wea town. They were garrisoned by
small detachments of British troops. Pontiac's
conspiracy to drive the British out of the country
included the capture and destruction of all
the posts then held by the British west of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
mountains. The two other posts in Indiana
were captured, but Vincennes, being still under
the command of St. Ange, was not attacked.
Pontiac endeavored to enlist St. Ange in his
warfare against the colonists, but that astute
officer was proof against all his blandishments.
When the treaty of 1763 was made known, St.
Ange was transferred to the command of Fort
Chartres, on the Mississippi, and left the affairs
of Vincennes under the control of three of the
more prominent citizens.</p>

<p>The British reoccupied Fort Miamis, at the
head of the Maumee, and garrisoned Fort
Chartres, but did not occupy Vincennes or assume
control over its affairs. General Gage,
commander-in-chief of the British forces in
America, issued a proclamation to the people
of Vincennes offering them the privilege of remaining
or of removing to the French or Spanish
possessions, assuring them that if they
remained they should have the same religious
privileges as had been granted to the people of
Canada. In a later proclamation he informed
the inhabitants that he would not recognize
any claim they had to the lands in and around
the Post.</p>

<p>The priest of the little parish and some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the leading citizens memorialized the General,
showing that the lands had been held by them
for many years under grants recognized by the
French government, and that it would be a
hardship now to deprive them of the rights they
had so long enjoyed. On the receipt of this
memorial General Gage ordered that all evidences
of title be submitted to him at Boston.
This, for various reasons, could not be done.
Many of the written grants had, as was the custom
in France, been left in charge of a notary,
who had disappeared with them. In other
cases, the grants had been verbal, title passing
again, after a French fashion, by the giving
of possession with certain ceremonies. While
this matter was in contest between the citizens
of Vincennes and General Gage, the first mutterings
of the American Revolution brought
the General duties of more pressing interest,
and nothing further was done in regard to
the land grants at Vincennes.</p>

<p>From 1763, when St. Ange left for Fort
Chartres, until 1777, the people of Vincennes
had no civil government except such as they
exercised themselves. On May 19, 1777,
Lieutenant-Governor Abbott, of Detroit, arrived
and formally took possession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
place for the King, establishing a government
and building a small stockade fort, which he
named "Fort Sackville." He reported the
"Wabache" as one of the finest rivers in the
world, and spoke highly of the peaceful and
correct attitude of the citizens of Vincennes.
He also took supervision of the garrisons at
Ouiatenon and Fort Miamis, and the work of
the British agents in stirring up the Indians to
active hostilities against the Americans began.</p>

<p>The arrival of Lieutenant-Governor Abbott,
and the hostilities of the Indians he encouraged,
gave rise to the most interesting chapter in the
history of Vincennes, and one of the most
dramatic chapters in the history of the United
States. Through the influence of the British
agents, the savages made a number of forays
against the people of Kentucky, and brought
about an event which added an empire to the
United States.</p>

<p>In all American history there is no story
more remarkable than that of George Rogers
Clark, yet it is one of the least known. Some
of the encyclopædias do not even mention him,
while others dismiss with a few lines a man
who gave an empire to the United States.
He lived a remarkable life, performed great
services for his country, and was then permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
to die in extreme poverty in his old age. His
country neglected even to reimburse him for
the expenses incurred while winning for it an
empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_221.jpg">FORT SACKVILLE, 1779.</a><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></div>

<p>In 1777 Clark was a citizen of Kentucky.
The great question to the people of Kentucky
was how best to defend themselves against the
Indian forays. Clark, through reports of spies
he had sent out, became satisfied that the Indian
hostilities were fomented by the British at
the various posts northwest of the Ohio River.
He went to Virginia and laid the facts before
Governor Patrick Henry. He pointed out
that the best, if not the only, way to protect
the people of Kentucky was to capture and
hold the posts at Kaskaskia, Vincennes, and
Detroit; that with those posts in the possession
of the Americans they could overawe and
hold in subjection the various Indian tribes.
He offered in person to lead an expedition for
their capture.</p>

<p>It was known to Governor Henry that the
Spaniards west of the Mississippi had been
secretly trying, with some encouragement, to
induce the people of Kentucky to place themselves
under Spanish protection. When Clark
approached him with the suggestion to capture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the posts northwest of the Ohio, Governor
Henry at first regarded the project as
chimerical. One day, after a long argument,
Clark left his presence with the significant remark
"that a country that was not worth
defending was not worth possessing." Interpreting
this remark to mean that if Virginia
would not help to defend Kentucky the
people there would seek protection from Spain,
Governor Henry recalled Clark, and after a
further conference, authorized him to recruit
350 men for the capture of the posts.</p>

<p>He gave him also a small supply of Virginia
money and some ammunition. Returning to
Kentucky, Clark hastily recruited a number of
men, without divulging his purpose to them.
They rendezvoused on an island in the Ohio
River, opposite the site of Louisville. There he
explained his full design, and all but about
150 refused to join the expedition. Undismayed,
Clark floated the few men remaining
with him down the river in boats prepared for
the purpose, and captured Kaskaskia on the
4th of July, 1778. Hearing that the British
had a large force at Vincennes, and had gathered
around the fort a large number of Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
hostile to the Americans, he waited at Kaskaskia
till he could get further information.</p>

<p>The cordial welcome which the French inhabitants
of Kaskaskia gave the Americans
led Clark to believe that the inhabitants of
Vincennes would prove friendly. French in
both places, they were easily led by their
priests. The priest at Kaskaskia, Father
Gibault, a warm partisan of Clark, offered to
go to Vincennes, sound the inhabitants, and
learn the strength of the British there. His
offer was accepted, and with a single companion
he made the journey. He found the
French inhabitants, in the absence of the commander
of the post, who had gone to Detroit,
willing to welcome a change of rulers, and induced
them to go in a body to the little church
and take an oath of allegiance to the American
colonies. After this they took possession of
Fort Sackville, and garrisoned it with some of
their own number. Father Gibault also induced
the Indians to bury the hatchet and
promise to live in peace with the Americans,
now the friends, as he reminded them, of their
great French father.</p>

<p>The news of his success was speedily sent
to Clark. Though he had no troops to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
send to garrison the fort, he dispatched Captain
Leonard Helm to assume direction of
affairs. This was a fortunate selection, for
Helm added to great courage, tact and an
intimate knowledge of the Indian character.</p>

<p>It was not long before the British authorities
at Detroit were informed of the change in
the situation at Kaskaskia and Vincennes,
and at once began preparations to recover
the lost ground. At this time Colonel Henry
Hamilton, of the British army, was Lieutenant-Governor
of Detroit. He assembled a
force of five hundred men&mdash;regulars, militia
and Indians&mdash;and started for Vincennes. Captain
Helm did not learn of the approach of
this force until, about the middle of December,
it was within three miles of the fort.
His garrison consisted of one American and a
few inhabitants of Vincennes. Seeing that it
would be impossible to defend the fort, the
inhabitants quietly dispersed to their homes,
leaving Helm and his one American in the fort.
Though he knew he could not successfully defend
the fort, Helm put on a bold front, loaded
his two cannon, and placed himself at one and
his solitary soldier at the other. To Hamilton's
demand for the surrender of the post, Helm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
replied that no man could enter the post until
the terms of surrender were made known.
Being promised the honors of war, he surrendered
himself and his one man, to the
chagrin of Hamilton, on discovering the size of
the garrison.</p>

<p>The approach of the British had been so
sudden that Helm was not able to dispatch
a messenger to Clark, who in consequence remained
for several weeks in ignorance of the
change in the situation. The last word he
had received from Helm was a request for
more supplies. At that time Francis Vigo, a
merchant of St. Louis, happened to be in Kaskaskia.
Loving the Americans and hating
the British, he volunteered to go to Vincennes
and make arrangements to furnish the garrison
with supplies. Vigo started on his journey at
once, but was captured by the British just
before he reached Vincennes, and taken before
Hamilton. To his demand for immediate
release on the score that he was a citizen of
St. Louis, Hamilton was deaf, until the Roman
Catholic priest, heading a delegation of citizens,
notified Hamilton that they would furnish
no supplies for the garrison unless Vigo
were released.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Vigo was released, after promising against
his will that "on his way to St. Louis he would
do no act hostile to the British interest." He
at once took a canoe and was rapidly paddled
down the Wabash to the Ohio, then on to St.
Louis. Keeping the letter of his pledge he
did nothing hostile on his way to St. Louis,
but on his arrival there he jumped from the
boat to the land and then back into the boat,
and pushed with all speed for Kaskaskia, where
he told Clark of the condition of affairs.</p>

<span class="caption"><a class="smcap">General George Rogers Clark.</a></span>
</div>

<p>Clark at once saw the danger surrounding
him. The term of enlistment of most of his
men was about to expire. By making them
large promises he induced about 150 to extend
their enlistment for a term of eight
months, and recruited about fifty more from
the inhabitants of Kaskaskia. He could get
no reinforcements short of Virginia, even
if he could obtain them there. If he waited
until spring Hamilton would be largely reinforced,
he would be driven from Kaskaskia,
and his whole design frustrated. He
determined to make a winter campaign. He
sent forty-six of his men in boats carrying provisions
and ammunition around by water, and
with 170 set off February 5, 1779, to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
a march of near two hundred miles. It was
a fearful enterprise. The land for most of
the way was level, and water, when it rained,
or when the snow melted, lay in a broad sheet
over the whole
country. He did
not know how
many of his foes
were before him.
He had no tents
to shelter his men
and no way of
transporting baggage;
there were
a few pack horses
to carry what provisions
and ammunition
the men
could not carry
on their backs.</p>

<p>His men were all hardy frontiersmen; their
leader had imbued them with his own heroic
spirit; they feared no danger. Before they
left the little settlement of Kaskaskia, the
good priest gave them a blessing, and all the
people accompanied them the first three or
four miles of their journey. Scarcely had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
farewells been said and the march begun when
the rain began to fall, and for nearly twenty
days there was but a brief glimpse of sunshine
now and then.</p>

<p>Only a few miles had been covered when
they struck a long stretch of overflowed land.
Although the water was cold, into it they
plunged, their gallant leader in front; and
until the evening of the 22d they saw no dry
land, except an occasional half-acre or so barely
peeping above the flood of waters and furnishing
a meagre resting-place. It can hardly
be said they rested, for on several occasions
they had to remain standing throughout the
night, or were compelled to walk about to keep
from freezing. When they came to a river
that had overflowed its banks and was too
deep to ford, they made canoes and rafts and
floated over.</p>

<p>Always they found the water covered with
a thin coating of ice in the morning, and
through the ice and water they forced their
way. When the water was deep the sergeant
carried the drummer boy on his shoulders, and
from that perch he beat his charge. Sometimes
the water was only knee-deep; sometimes
it reached the middle and often to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
shoulders; but not one of the men thought of
turning back. The boat with provisions that
had been sent around by water failed to connect
and to their other discomforts hunger
was added.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 21st they came
within sound of the morning gun at Fort
Sackville, but it required two more days of
wandering without provisions before they could
cross the Wabash River. At last they captured
some Indians and with them the half of a buffalo
rump, which they made into a broth. On
the 23d they arrived at the heights back of
the town, and for the first time since their
departure had an opportunity to dry their
clothing. Clark sent a letter to the French
inhabitants of the town, telling them of his
presence, but warning them not to give any
information to Hamilton. The news caused
the greatest excitement; the French ran about
the streets telling it with joy, for Hamilton
had won their hatred. They sent out provisions
to the hungry Americans, who that night
marched into the town and by opening
fire on the fort gave the first intimation to
Hamilton and the garrison of the presence of
an enemy. The firing was continued until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
about nine o'clock the next morning, when
a surrender was demanded, accompanied by a
threat that if the place had to be taken by
storm the officers would be treated as murderers.
A parley ensued, followed after a few
hours by the surrender of the fort, and once
more the American flag floated over Fort
Sackville, which was then renamed Fort Patrick
Henry.</p>

<p>Hamilton and the other officers were sent to
Williamsburg, Va., where they were held in
custody for a year or two. From papers found
in the fort, Clark learned that reinforcements,
bringing supplies and stores, were on the way,
and at once sent a part of his little force to
intercept and capture the reinforcements, which
was promptly done.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Vincennes was now the most important
place in the Illinois country. When Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
John Todd was appointed Lieutenant for the
County of Illinois, he made Colonel Legrace
his deputy for Vincennes, who established the
first court the place ever had. Virginia ceded
the territory to the United States, and by the
Ordinance of 1787 a civil government was set
up, Governor St. Clair sending Winthrop Sargent
to assume direct jurisdiction at Vincennes.
The French inhabitants were finally permitted
to hold the lands to which they could show
title, while all the rest were taken by the Government.</p>

<p>Clark added an empire to the domain of the
colonies, made possible the Louisiana Purchase
and the future extension of the country
to the Pacific, and then in his extreme old age
Virginia sent him only a sword when he asked
for repayment of what he had disbursed for
the country.</p>

<p>In 1800 Indiana Territory was established
with Vincennes as its capital. The jurisdiction
of the Territory then included what are
now the States of Indiana, Illinois, Michigan,
and Wisconsin, and a part of Minnesota, and
to this was afterward added for a short time
the whole of the Louisiana Purchase.</p>

<div class="figleft">

</div>

<p>On the 4th of July, 1800, the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of Indiana Territory was formally organized.
The Governor, William Henry Harrison, was,
however, not present. General John Gibson,
who represented him, was one of the Revolutionary
heroes. He had married a sister of
Logan, the celebrated Mingo chief, and it
was to his brother
that Logan made his
famous speech.
On his arrival,
Governor Harrison began
the work of
trading the Indians
out of their lands.
He made one treaty
after another, until
more than one half
of the present Indiana,
together with
a good part of Illinois, was ceded. He erected
the first brick house in all that section, perhaps
the first west of the Alleghanies, in its day a
structure so magnificent as to be called the
"Governor's Palace." It is still standing, and
near it the tree under which the Governor held
his historic interview with Tecumseh, when the
Indian chief planned the Governor's death.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_235.jpg">ST. XAVIER'S CHURCH, 1779.</a><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></div>

<p>In 1813 the territorial capital was removed
to Corydon, and the political importance of
Vincennes ceased. Already a university had
been established, Congress giving to it a township
of land, and the beginning was made for
what is now one of the most valuable libraries
in the West. The first church in the Northwest
Territory was built in Vincennes about
1742, under the rectorship of Father Meurin,
who had come from France to care for the
spiritual wants of the settlers. In 1793 M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Rivet, a French priest, driven from his native
country by the terrors of the Revolution, arrived
at Vincennes and opened the first school
taught in Indiana.</p>

<p>The Vincennes of to-day is a thriving,
bustling city of ten thousand inhabitants. It
has modern schools and modern churches,
modern ideas and modern progressiveness.
As a city it has had its ups and downs since it
lost political prestige, but for some years it has
steadily grown, until now it is classed as one
of the beautiful cities of the State. Surrounded
by a magnificent agricultural section,
and with many manufacturing interests, it
threw off long ago the old French habits and
customs and took on a progressive spirit,
which promises a bright future.</p>

<p>Vincennes has had a glorious past; it occupies
a unique place among the historic towns
of the country. Boston may have been the
cradle of American independence; Philadelphia
the place where that liberty was first announced;
but after all Boston gave to the
Union only Massachusetts, and Philadelphia
only Pennsylvania. Vincennes gave us Indiana,
Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin,
the great Middle West. But for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
genius and perseverance of George Rogers
Clark, when independence came the United
Colonies would have stopped at the Alleghanies.
The capture of Vincennes spread the
jurisdiction of the colonies to the Mississippi,
carrying with it American liberty, American
progress, American ideas. More than this, it
made possible the Louisiana Purchase, which
in turn opened the way to the annexation of
Texas, the securing of California and the
Pacific coast, and the later acquisition of
Hawaii and the Philippines. The capture of
Vincennes carried American liberty to a domain
stretching from the Alleghany Mountains
to the Pacific Ocean, yea even to the Orient&mdash;a
domain which else would still be British or
Spanish.</p>

<p>It was Indiana, of which Vincennes was the
chief part, that stopped the extension of
slavery at the Ohio River, and made all the
Northwest free territory. It was at Vincennes
that Aaron Burr received his first decided
check in his great scheme to dismember the
Union. It was Benjamin Parke, a citizen of
Vincennes, who placed in the first constitution
of the State the clause making it obligatory on
the Legislature to provide for the care and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
treatment of the insane, the first provision of
the kind made by any civilized government, a
provision which has revolutionized the treatment
of the insane throughout the world. Such
is the story of Vincennes, no frontier town like
Albany or Pittsburg, for when its history
began Vincennes was hundreds of miles out
in the wilderness beyond the frontier line,
and was still hundreds of miles beyond when
the great event occurred which changed it
from a French settlement under the jurisdiction
of Great Britain into the chief seat of American
power west of the Alleghanies.</p>

<h2>CHICAGO<br />

LARGE IN EVERY WAY</h2>

<p class="chapby">By LYMAN J. GAGE</p>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">T</span>HE plotting of the site of Chicago was
characteristic of the practical sentiment
that has ever stimulated the city. No less a
personage than Washington established the
streets and boundaries of the national capital;
religious romance presided at the founding of
San Francisco; interesting legends cluster
about the origin of other American communities;
and in the old world demigods were supposed
to have watched over the beginnings of
ancient cities. Chicago, though neither hero
nor fabled deity was present when its foundations
were laid, had a start none the less imposing,
for the genius of industry and trade
fixed its metes and bounds. And in the growth
of the city into perhaps the industrial capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of the continent there has been presented a
supreme expression of that resourceful and
triumphant ingenuity which has redeemed the
American wilderness. The desolation upon
which the plodding engineer planted his theodolite
three-score-and-ten years ago is a colossal
hive of human activity. A marsh has
become a metropolis.</p>

<p>The promoters of the Illinois and Michigan
Canal were not the first to see the possibility
of water communication via the present site
of Chicago between the Great Lakes and the
Mississippi River.</p>

<p>In 1673, Joliet wrote to the authorities in
Canada that by the cutting of a canal through
half a league of prairie it would be possible
for boats to "pass from the Lake of Illinois
into the St. Louis River [the Illinois including
the Desplaines] which empties into the Mississippi."
One hundred years before our Republic
was conceived, a mathematician, but no
mere <i>visionnaire</i>, the son of a wheelwright of
Quebec, realized that the "Portage of Checagau"
was the meeting-place of the future
traffic between the chain of inland seas and
the rivers flowing toward the Mexican Gulf.</p>

<p>It is plain that nature located Chicago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
The meeting-point between unparalleled watercourses
could not but be a place for the distribution
of commodities. To the north, awaiting
the woodman, were the lumber regions of
Michigan and Wisconsin; south and west and
east stretched the prairie, to be developed into
farms; in Illinois alone, thirty thousand square
miles of coal fields were to be uncovered, while
Pennsylvania's inexhaustible supply was to find
a vast market at this centre of lake shipping;
and the iron, red-stone, and copper regions of
Lake Superior were to pile their output on
Chicago docks. The natural meeting-place of
grain, lumber, fuel, and iron would have become
a city of commerce and manufactures,
even if steam railroads and navigation had not
come to assist in the unique development of
this <i>entrepôt</i>, by making it the half-way house
for transcontinental traffic. But though nature,
as the Rev. Robert Collyer has said,
"called the lakes, the forest, the prairies together
in convention, and they decided that
on this spot a great city should be built,"
Chicago has been singularly blessed in the
alert and enterprising genius of her citizens.
Her business men have worked with catholic
outlook, knowing that what upbuilt the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
in general would augment their individual
projects.</p>

<p>The city has never been, even in its aboriginal
beginnings, an abiding-place for visionaries.
The Minneways were a picturesque
tribe. Their chiefs assumed poetic names,
and the young men cherished the traditions
of their people; but the tribe did not take advantage
of its strategic opportunities. Checagau
to them was not a coign of vantage
between great waters. At the shore of a vast
lake, or the brink of a broad river, their dominion
halted, for they were not navigators.
In their dialect, "Checagau" meant "wild
onion." As if to typify the force that was to
dominate their region in later centuries, the
Checagau country fell to the conquering
"canoe men," the adventurous Pottawatomies,
the Chippewas, the Sacs, and kindred tribes
who, unafraid to venture on the water, turned
to trade, exchanging furs and pelts with the
French pioneers for food, blankets, and ornamental
trinkets. They became the masters
of the lake country, and the broken remnant
of the uncommercial tribe fled to the Wabash,
there to wail their plaintive songs.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile the conquering tribesmen, whose
canoes paddled up the Mississippi and the
Illinois to the "Checagau Portage," to barter
with Canadian <i>voyageurs</i>, or glided thence
across the Lakes, touching at the outposts of
colonizers and missionary friars, were prefiguring
the gigantic activities of civilized men
who in a later age were to radiate from this
same coveted point of distribution. But as
they had won their Checagau country by
might, and established their holdings by commercial
enterprise, so they resisted the coming
of their European rivals and masters. Although
as early as 1795, by the treaty of
Greenville, they ceded much domain to our
country, including "one piece of land six
miles square, at the mouth of the Checagau
River," the intrigue of the powerful Tecumseh
and his brother, the Prophet, led the tribes to
disregard these and subsequent treaty stipulations.
So that when, on the same day that saw
the capitulation of Detroit, Fort Dearborn
was burned and its garrison massacred,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"the last vestige," says Henry Adams, "of American
authority on the western lakes disappeared. Thenceforward
the line of the Wabash and the Maumee became
the military boundary of the United States in the
northwest, and the country felt painful doubt whether
even that line could be defended."</p></blockquote>

<p>For four years the unburied bones of the
Fort Dearborn victims lay where the bodies
had fallen. Then came peace, Christian interment
of these pathetic human fragments,
and a reorganization of the valuable fur trade
of the region. The spot again became the
centre of this industry. Trading posts were
re-established on the Illinois River and the
Kankakee with the Pottawatomies of the
prairies; at Rock River with the Winnebagoes;
at Milwaukee with the Menomonies,
and at Le Large with the Kickapoos. Trains
of pack horses carried the furs and peltries
to Chicago, and in the spring vessels touching
at that port bore these valuable cargoes to
Mackinac, where the American Fur Company,
organized by John Jacob Astor, had established
its headquarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_245.jpg">THE DEARBORN MONUMENT.</a><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></div>

<p>In 1821, Governor Lewis Cass of Michigan
Territory and Solomon Sibley, with Henry
R. Schoolcraft as their secretary, representing
the United States, met three thousand Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
braves at Chicago. Topinebee and Meeta were
spokesmen for the tribes. In consideration of
five thousand dollars, to be paid annually for
five years, the Pottawatomies and other tribes
ceded to this Government 5,000,000 acres of
land lying in Michigan and Illinois. The
marvellous real estate transactions subsequently
negotiated in Chicago, whereby citizens
have multiplied their millions, have not
eclipsed this profitable investment of the Federal
Government in 1821.</p>

<p>Although some minds foresaw a possible
future for Chicago in this centre of a rich domain
owned by the Republic, there was no rush
to the spot. In 1823, the officials of Fulton
County, of which the village was then a part,
levied a tax of five mills to the dollar upon
property in the new port, with the result that
there was carried back to the county treasury
the sum of $11.42. Surely a small beginning
to lead to taxes in 1900 amounting to
$19,086,408.36. In 1823, when the sum of
$11.42 was the aggregate of taxes collected
from Chicago, the total assessed value of property
was $2284. In 1900, the actual valuation
of Chicago property was fairly $2,000,000,000.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>No one, perhaps, of the few settlers who
drifted to the place dreamed of such mighty
possibilities, yet as early as 1831 the future of
the city was a chosen topic of conversation
among those enthusiastic pioneers. One of
these, Dr. Elijah D. Harmon, true to his baptismal
name, was singularly prophetic. He located
in Chicago in 1831, acquired a section
of land, built a sod fence about it, and there
planted fruit trees of all descriptions. Mrs.
Kinzie states that the south path to the settlement
led by Dr. Harmon's nursery, and
that as people passed he sought to impress
upon them "the certain future importance of
Chicago."</p>

<p>In 1830, lots were being sold at prices ranging
from $10 to $50. In that year Thomas
Hartzell purchased eighty acres (being the
west half of the northeast quarter section) for
<ins class="corr" title='Correction: Text was .$155'>$1.55</ins> an acre. Low as these prices were, they
were an advance upon valuations a few years
before. In the archives of the Chicago Historical
Society is a letter written to John
Wentworth by Father St. Cyr, recounting how
one Bonhomme sold the north half of Chicago
to Pierre Ménard for $50, but that the latter,
finding land cheaper near Peoria, and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
fertile, repented of his bargain, and hurrying
back unloaded what he believed to be a poor
investment upon John Kinzie, who was not
unwilling to take the property at the same
figure at which Ménard had purchased it. By
1835, values had so increased that the investment
had made Mr. Kinzie rich.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_249.jpg">THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT BUILDING, CHICAGO.</a><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></div>

<p>The belief which soon began to take possession
of the minds of white men, that the little
settlement was to be a city set in the midst of
a new empire of civilization, had also aroused
the celebrated Indian, Black Hawk. He was
convinced that, unless the tribes could be
federated into compact opposition to their conquering
enemies, the hunting-grounds of his
people would speedily be converted into the
homes and cities of the paleface. Emulating
the career of Tecumseh, Black Hawk in 1832
addressed a grand council, attended by representatives
of fifty tribes. "Let all our tribes
unite," said he, "and we shall have an army of
warriors equal in numbers to the trees of the
forest." The appeal was eloquent and moving,
but Shawbonee, who had been with Tecumseh
when that leader fell at the battle of
the Thames, answered Black Hawk. "Your
army," he cried, "would equal in number the
trees of the forest, and you would encounter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
an army of palefaces as numerous as the leaves
of those trees." The arguments of Shawbonee
prevailed, the native attempt at coalition was
defeated, and henceforward the activities of
the white races in peopling the valley of the
Mississippi and building to the northward,
on the shore of Lake Michigan, its great
metropolis, proceeded without any one to
molest or make afraid. Thus Shawbonee
(whose name is variously spelled), in successfully
opposing the red men's far-reaching
conspiracy, assisted materially in advancing
the interests of Chicago. In token of this
service, the Historical Society has given his
portrait a place of honor, and has preserved
the record of his deeds.</p>

<p>Late in July, 1833, three years after the
canal surveyor, James Thompson, had surveyed
and mapped out the town which was
to be, a public meeting was held to decide
whether incorporation should be effected.
There were twelve votes in favor of incorporation,
and one against, and the place
made its start among historic towns. A
few days later the following election notice
was posted:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"Publick notice is hereby given that an election will
be holden at the house of Mark Beaubien, on Saturday,
the 10th day of August, at 11 o'clock in the forenoon of
that day, for the purpose of choosing five trustees of the
Town of Chicago.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Chicago</span>, August 5, 1833.</p>

<p class="cen">"<span class="smcap">E.S. Kimberly</span>, Town Clerk.</p>

<p>"N.B. The poll will close at one o'clock."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the appointed day, twenty-eight electors,
the full number of citizens entitled to suffrage
in the new town, found their way to Mark
Beaubien's house and availed themselves of
the privilege of freemen. Thirteen of them
announced their willingness to shoulder the
responsibilities of office. The first business
transacted by the trustees was the establishment
of a free ferry across the river at Dearborn
Street; the second, the reconstruction of
the "estray pen" into a solid and sufficiently
commodious log jail. These two programmes&mdash;the
extension of commercial facilities and
the stern suppression of lawlessness&mdash;have
ever since been conspicuous in the city's
history.</p>

<p>Then the town was born. Its development
into a municipal Titan is one of the marvels
of history. In 1830, P.F.W. Peck arrived
on a schooner, bringing with him a small stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of goods. "He built," says Mr. Colbert, "a
small log store near the fort, which made an
important addition to the trade of Chicago."
In the year 1900, just seventy years later, the
amount of wholesale goods distributed from
this centre throughout the country amounted
to $741,000,000, the volume of drygoods alone
being $143,000,000; groceries, $99,000,000;
clothing, $35,000,000; shoes, $58,500,000;
books and paper, $70,000,000, and other items
in proportion; while the manufactured products
sent forth aggregated in value $786,000,000,
and the total business of the city
reached the high figure of $1,963,000,000.
The year that concluded the nineteenth century
recorded transfers of real estate amounting
in round numbers to $87,000,000, in
striking contrast to that early transaction
wherein Chicago's first investor repented him
of paying $50 for the northern half of the
city.</p>

<p>But the little town was not to achieve great
things without a struggle. Fire, flood, panic,
and pestilence had first to be faced and fought.
The small band in the incorporated town
started out determined to develop the settlement
into a city, notwithstanding the dismal
prophecies of certain learned men that a city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
would never rise on this unpropitious swamp.
Professor William H. Keating, geologist and
historiographer, had furnished the pioneer
townsmen with the melancholy message:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_253.jpg">AUDITORIUM HOTEL, CHICAGO.</a><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></div>

<blockquote><p>"The dangers attending the navigation of the lake,
and the scarcity of harbors along the shore, must ever
prove an obstacle to the increase of the commercial
importance of Chicago. The extent of the sand banks
which are formed on the eastern and southern shore by
the prevailing north and northwesterly winds will likewise
prevent any important works from being undertaken
to improve the port of Chicago."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the light of this prediction it is interesting
to note that in 1900 the vessels mooring or
weighing anchor there numbered 17,553, and
brought and carried away cargoes aggregating
14,236,190 tons. Nevertheless, for some
years, because of the quagmire condition of
streets and the frequent inundations from lake
and river, Chicago was termed derisively the
"amphibious town." By filling in the land,
the city long since literally lifted itself out of
the mud, the level of streets to-day being
eight feet above the original marsh. But
even before the transformation of the town
into a city, it was plain that the founders had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
come to build it into a centre of trade and
population. Encouraging progress was being
made on the Illinois and Michigan Canal, the
population of the town was increasing, neighboring
prairies were being tilled, and the
water carriers who drove their carts into the
lake, filled their barrels, and then distributed
water by the bucketful, were giving way to
the Hydraulic Company. A new era was at
hand, and Chicago on the 4th of March, 1837,
became an organized municipality.</p>

<p>The first census, taken in July, 1837,
showed a population in the city of 1800 men,
845 women, and 1344 children. With a colored
population of 77, the grand total of inhabitants
in this its first year's existence as a
city was 4066. To-day its population is nearing
the two-million mark.</p>

<p>O.D. Wetherell, ex-city Comptroller, recalls
a letter, written at an early date by a
citizen, in which the prediction was made that
some day Chicago would become a city of
10,000 people! At the time, that prophecy
seemed to be more wildly optimistic than
would a prediction now that the city might
ultimately harbor the amazing total of ten
million persons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>The early promoters of Chicago were sanguine
of a great future, but none dreamed of
the amazing destiny in store. At a political
gathering in 1838, addressed by Stephen A.
Douglas and John T. Stuart, his competing
candidate for Congress, a local orator, warmed
by the enthusiasm of the occasion, uttered
what was derisively referred to the next day
as "flamboyant prophecy."</p>

<p>"The child is already born," he exclaimed,
"who shall live to see Chicago a city of 50,000
souls."</p>

<p>"Town lots, town lots!" shouted the audience
in amiable sarcasm, not wishing the
visiting statesman to depart with the suspicion
that dreams of real-estate speculation had
destroyed the sanity of the whole community.</p>

<p>For three years the town had been the centre
of a great land craze, one of the first real-estate
booms that have played so important a
part in the location and development of Western
cities. Dr. Horace Chase, writing in
1883 from Milwaukee, says:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_257.jpg">THE ART INSTITUTE, CHICAGO.</a><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></div>

<blockquote><p>"Soon after the sale of lots in Chicago, in 1833, I think,
Robert Kinzie, on his way to Detroit, stopped at Marsh's
trading post near Coldwater. There happened to be
several of us present and Bob began to boast about
Chicago and what a great city it would become. 'Why,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
said he, 'I bought some of the best lots in Chicago for
twenty dollars apiece, and those lots are worth sixty
dollars apiece to-day!' It seemed to us utterly absurd
that a lot should be worth sixty dollars, when two hundred
dollars would buy one hundred and sixty acres of
the best quality. Not a single person in the crowd
believed Bob's yarn."</p></blockquote>

<p>As an example of the spirit which animated
these old pioneers who came in the early days
to the great city that was to be, the story of
one man furnishes an interesting illustration.
The writer had it from the lips of the man
himself, who recently died at the ripe age of
eighty-two.</p>

<blockquote><p>"I had heard of the West," he said, "in the little hamlet
in New England where I was born. My ambition was
fired, and I determined at all hazards to seek my fortune
there. I soon found myself in Buffalo with seven dollars
in my pocket, and with this I had to pay my
transportation to the young city in the West. After
considerable 'higgling' with the captain of a schooner I
arranged for deck passage at a cost of three dollars.
Part of my money was then expended to get some
cotton cloth. This I sewed up in the shape of a bag,
and into it I put some shavings to soften the hard planks
of the deck of the ship at night. The balance of the
money went for boiled ham, cheese, and bread.</p>

<p>"I was twenty years old, had been a farm boy, and
had attained no special knowledge of any manual trade.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>I arrived in Chicago and found it a dismal, swampy
place, but with every appearance of thrift and activity.
My money was exhausted, and work was indispensable.
Going along the one important street or road I found a
man building a rather pretentious boarding house. He
asked me if I 'came off that ship in the harbor,' and
when I answered 'yes,' he inquired whether there were
any carpenters on board. I told him there was none
excepting myself. He wanted to know if I could 'lay
out work' so that his men could saw and hammer,
which was all they could do. It seemed to me that I
could 'lay out work' better than anything else, and
engaged myself to him at four dollars a day. Two
days satisfied my new boss that my technical knowledge
was deficient, and he paid me off. I soon afterwards
found work in a harness shop, and by assiduity and
attention I acquired a knowledge of that business.
Thus I got my start."</p></blockquote>

<p>This man lived continuously in Chicago for
more than sixty years. By early and judicious
investments in real estate he acquired wealth.
He bought a lot, now centrally located, for
$400, and sold a part of it thirty years later
for $62,500. He sold it too soon, however,
for that same corner will bring at the present
time not less than $500,000. At his death he
left an estate valued at between $5,000,000
and $6,000,000.</p>

<p>Fortunes were made over night. In 1835<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the Federal Government opened a land office,
and this intensified the excitement. Boundless
acres of outlying farmland changed hands
in Chicago. Towns and cities that had no
existence save on the blue prints of imaginative
and wily promoters were plotted,
and their mythical blocks sold to hasty and
credulous investors. But the panic of 1837
brought both legitimate and illicit real-estate
traffic to a close with a crash. The dishonest
and the defrauded went down in a common
ruin. By 1838 the sheriff was the only real-estate
agent who could dispose of property,
and at these forced sales the returns were
meager. Panic paralyzing business, a mysterious
disease like Asiatic cholera stopping
progress on the canal, and a drought destroying
crops, impoverishing streams, and spreading
devastating fever in the city, was the
calamitous record of 1838.</p>

<p>Chicago as a city began with $1993 in its
treasury. The need for municipal improvement
was imperative. Where to get money
for sanitary drainage, for the paving of a few
streets, and the purchase of two fire engines,
was a problem. The Common Council appointed
a finance committee with power to act.
Peter Bolles was made chairman. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
finally decided to borrow $25,000 from the
State Bank of Illinois, pledging the city to redeem
the obligation in five years. In due
time the committee submitted as its report
the following letter:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_261.jpg">STATUE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN BY ST. GAUDENS.</a><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a></div>

<p class="quotdate">"Your o'bt serv't,</p>

<p class="quotdate">"<span class="smcap">N.H. Ridgely</span>, Cashier."
</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1900 the city which sixty-three years before
could not borrow $25,000, could boast of
bank clearances amounting to $6,795,876,000.</p>

<p>The poverty and disasters of early days
seemed only to nerve the city to renewed
determination and prepare her to meet with
stoic faith the appalling calamities of later
years. In this résumé it is only possible to
catalogue the misfortunes that visited her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Floods swept away her shipping, fire destroyed
her accumulating industries, raging epidemics
reduced her population&mdash;cholera alone in 1854
causing 1424 deaths&mdash;and financial panic again
and again returned to manacle activities. Many
times in Chicago's history citizens could well
exclaim: "One woe upon another's heels doth
tread, so fast they follow!"</p>

<p>Unconquerable in the presence of these recurrent
visitations, the city pressed forward to
her place as the metropolis of the Mississippi
empire. At an early day "prairie schooners,"
pioneers of the great freight trains to come,
laden with grain from the fertile areas round
about began to line the prairie roads leading
to Chicago. In 1839, two years after the city
was begun, a crude grain elevator was constructed.
The farmers, too poor to furnish sacks,
brought their grain in sheets, blankets,
and pieces of canvas. It was hoisted by hand
with block and tackle to the elevator, and in
the year mentioned 2900 bushels of wheat,
consigned to Black Rock, New York, were
dumped loose into the hold of the brig <i>Osceola</i>.
From this primitive beginning has grown a
mighty volume of trade in grain. In 1900 the
wheat, corn, oats, rye, and barley shipped from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Chicago amounted to 232,267,109 bushels,
while the receipts aggregated 307,723,135
bushels.</p>

<p>It was not until 1843 that the Common
Council came to the conclusion that the place
was sufficiently advanced as a city to warrant
the enactment of an ordinance declaring that
hogs should no longer be permitted to run at
large in the streets. In 1900, far from being
unwelcome, over 8,000,000 hogs, safely penned
in cars, arrived in the city and were sent to
the slaughter.</p>

<p>In writing of Chicago it is customary to
deal in superlatives, and this is necessary in
the nature of things. Its Union Stock Yards
cover 400 acres, nearly twice the area of the
original town. Twenty miles of streets thread
this meat-packing colony, which pays wages
amounting to nearly $9,000,000 a year. In
1900 there were shipped to Chicago 277,205
carloads of hogs, cattle, sheep, etc. Its trade
in grain leads every city in the world, while its
general mercantile traffic is surpassed by few.</p>

<p>The first railroad at that time was the
Galena and Chicago Union, which was chartered
January 16, 1836. Galena at that time
was believed to be destined far to outrival her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
neighbor, and therefore demanded and secured
the place of honor in the title of the road.
To-day thirty-nine distinct railroads enter Chicago,
more than half the railway systems of
America make that city their objective point,
and the aggregate distance traveled by freight
and passenger trains daily entering the metropolis
is over 80,000 miles. In the thunder of this
traffic the clamor of rivalry long since died
away. The British critic, Mr. Archer, remarked
that he was unable to detect the slightest evidence
of competition with Chicago even in a
"Pisgah view from the top of the Auditorium."</p>

<p>The employment of large adjectives in the
recital of the city's history is not without
warrant. "The trouble with you people in
Chicago," remarked a visitor, "is that you exaggerate
too much." "We have to," retorted
a citizen, proudly, "in fact we have to lie to
tell the truth." Even when we speak of the
fire of 1871, we must call it the "great Chicago
fire," for never before perhaps in the history of
the world were so many of the piled-up monuments
of man's hands consumed so rapidly.
Such awful moments, happily, seldom come in
the history of communities. It was as if the
fires of Dante's Inferno had been permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
for a night and day to devastate a great city
of this planet. One thousand four hundred
and seventy acres of buildings were utterly
consumed. The entire business portion of the
city vanished in smoke and flame. One hundred
thousand persons were left homeless and
in many cases penniless. Seventeen thousand
four hundred and fifty buildings were destroyed,
the total valuation of the loss by fire
being $186,000,000.</p>

<p>In the presence of a catastrophe, so vast that
the imagination reeled as the eye wandered
over the mighty paths where the cyclones of
fire had swept, social inequalities and race
prejudices were ignored. All right-minded
men stood together in a common bond of
fellowship. Doubtless much of the present
spirit of amalgamation of the people of the
city is an outgrowth of the calamity which
thirty years ago brought the representatives
of those divers races elbow to elbow in the
common cause of rebuilding their homes and
reconstructing their lines of industry. The
riots at the Haymarket did not indicate bad
blood between the races of the city, but merely
an incidental if not accidental social unrest
not uncommon in all our greater cities.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_267.jpg">RUINS OF THE GREAT FIRE, CHICAGO.</a><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></div>

<p>The city staggered, but did not fall, under
the woful wreck the great fire wrought.
Through a grim schooling of disaster in the
past the city had developed a force of character
that fire could not consume. "Nothing,"
exclaimed the great French Cardinal and
Premier of the seventeenth century, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
was temporarily overthrown, "nothing remains
but the indomitable spirit of Richelieu."
Chicago had similar faith in her own
inherent power. There were some broken
spirits who, gazing on the melancholy ruin,
caught no glimpse of the magnificent city that
was to rise, as if by command of a magician's
wand, upon the smoking desolation. But the
majority did not permit the calamity to crush.
The faithful were exhorted to rebuild the city.
It was predicted then that Chicago would live,
and live to be so mighty and so vast that the
great fire would be but an incident in its history.
The city was to live because beyond it
were the giant forces, the teeming millions,
the imperial area of the mighty West, which,
having made Chicago the gateway to the
East, would recreate it under the same natural
necessities.</p>

<p>The city's optimistic faith and determination
enlisted the sympathy of the world, and
$5,000,000 in relief contributions poured in
and thousands of telegrams offering credit to
merchants supplemented this hearty and timely
exhibition of Good Samaritanism. The deeds
of valor displayed by firemen and citizens in
fighting an unequal combat with the fire were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
equalled only by the heroism which appeared
in the rebuilding of the city. The first structure
to rise over the ruins was a board shanty,
twelve by sixteen feet in dimensions. It was
on Washington Street, between Dearborn and
Clark, near the site of a former flourishing
block, where W.D. Kerfoot had conducted a
large business in real estate. The tiny structure
was built hastily on the morning of October
10th, while the surrounding ashes and
heaps of twisted iron were so hot that the
little building had to be set in the middle of
the street. The comical cabin bore the legend,
"Kerfoot's Block. Everything gone but wife,
children, and energy." Small as the shanty
was, it was an inspiration. It marked the beginning
of a city now so vast that the municipality
existing before the fire seems but a
shadow. Through the city run paved streets
whose aggregate length would reach from
Chicago to New York, and start the traveller
some distance on his way to Boston. More
than 100,000 street lights, kept "trimmed and
burning" by the municipality at an annual
cost of over $1,000,000, twinkle in the city by
night.</p>

<p>Over a quarter of a billion of gallons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
water are consumed daily by a city now protected
by an efficient fire department against
a repetition of the disaster of 1871. Nearly
1500 miles of sewers preserve the sanitation,
while the superb ingenuity of engineers has
changed the courses and reversed the currents
of rivers, and with connecting canals turned
the city's sewage toward the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>The ambition of this characteristically American
city is to excel in everything. When
she undertook to hold a World's Fair, she determined
to eclipse any previous exposition,
and to secure a phenomenal attendance. When
she held a Parliament of Religions she arranged
that the faiths of every clime should
be represented by their most learned and pious
men, and that the teachings there set forth
should constitute a memorable contribution to
the best thought of the world. It has been
said of Chicago that when she decides to be
the home of the greatest poet among mankind,
she will go out and get him, or, better still,
produce him.</p>

<p>Cities affecting a more advanced culture
sniff at the stock-yard atmosphere which they
pretend to believe permeates the literary life
of Chicago, and Eugene Field, in playful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
mood, accepting the jibes of distant critics,
printed as the frontispiece of his <i>Culture's
Garland</i> a wreath of sausage links; but William
D. Howells has acknowledged that out of
Chicago is coming a literary virility destined
to leave classic record in the annals of letters.
Field himself occupies an honored place in the
American Pantheon, and his "Little Boy
Blue," though dead, forever sings his way to
our firesides.</p>

<p>The city takes high rank as a centre for
advanced education. In addition to technical
schools like the Armour Institute, it has two
famous Universities; the Chicago, and the
Northwestern. The Chicago University began
its career ten years ago. The old denominational
University of the same name
having been sold at auction under foreclosure,
John D. Rockefeller decided to reorganize it
and found a great institution of learning, and to
that end pledged a portion of his fortune and
secured as President, Dr. William R. Harper,
of Yale. The University opened in 1892
with 702 students. To-day it has nearly
4000. It began with no less than 135 instructors;
it now has 205. The University
made its start with grounds, buildings, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
equipments valued at $1,600,000, and invested
funds amounting to $1,500,000. To-day its
productive funds aggregate over $15,000,000.
Women have been prominent among the
University's donors, and in all the departments
women students enjoy equal status
with men. A student may enter at the beginning
of any quarter and receive his degree
at the end of any term. The colleges continue
throughout the year. Recently the
Chicago Institute, founded by Mrs. Emmons
Blaine for training school teachers, was absorbed
by the University. In fact, Dr. Harper
has succeeded in merging so many professional
schools that he has been amiably accused of
attempting to form an educational trust. The
Northwestern University, located partly in
the city and partly in Evanston, a suburb, was
founded in 1851. It has 296 instructors and
over 3000 students. Its productive funds
amount to over $3,000,000. Although conducted
under denominational auspices, its
charter provides that no particular religious
faith shall be required of students. It has a
campus of 45 acres on the Lake Michigan
shore. The University includes a college of
Liberal Arts, and schools of medicine, law,
pharmacy, dentistry, music, and theology.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Many of the departments are coeducational.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_273.jpg">PUBLIC LIBRARY, CHICAGO.</a><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a></div>

<p>The public schools of Chicago are crowded
with three quarters of a million children of
parents for few of whom "Plato and the
swing of Pleiades and the tall reaches of the
peaks of song" had a meaning. And these
children of every kindred and tongue are not
herded into classes and indifferently taught.
Modern science assists them from the start
with anthropometric examinations, and scientific
methods are in use in every school. There
could be no more hopeful "sign and portent"
of the city's future than is furnished by its
public schools.</p>

<p>Voluntarily, by popular vote of the people,
civil service was established in all branches of
the city administration, and the principle laid
down that industrious merit rather than political
influence should fill the thousands of
positions in the school department and city
branches in general, a graphic illustration that
the spoils system is not a Chicago ideal. Benevolent
institutions thrive under the munificent
endowment of its men of wealth. Seers
like Professor David Swing have preached
the Gospel to an eager people, thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
on Sunday being turned away, unable to
press to the pews through the multitude of
churchgoers. All these phenomena present
the interesting psychological truth that with
Chicago's liberty and cosmopolitan make-up
has been developed a reassuring force "making
for righteousness." The city is not yet
prepared for canonization, but in many ways it
is, in its largeness of life and tolerance, an example
to the cities of the world. She is still
apt, perhaps, in speaking, for example, of her
art galleries to dwell overmuch upon the cost
of the buildings and paintings and the number
of acres.</p>

<p>The unprejudiced critic or historian knows
that not all Chicago is pork and pig-iron,
though why these industries are not as honorable
as poetry and prose, perhaps they who
sit in the seat of the scornful will explain.
Booker T. Washington well says that a people
cannot be truly great until they recognize that
it is as dignified to till the soil as it is to
pen an epic, and in the same line of thought
it might be said that a people who "live
laborious days" packing meat and handling
lumber, particularly by the thousand carloads,
are not necessarily belated travellers on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
highway that leads to national integrity and
renown.</p>

<p>In wealth, in population, in the high character
and eager attendance in her great schools,
in libraries, art, and architecture, as evidenced
by institutes, buildings, and academies of design,
in her letters, as displayed by the literary
output, in her spiritual conquests, as shown
in the teachings of her poets and preachers,
and even in the periodical reforms that purify
the political atmosphere, Chicago's future will
undoubtedly be, like her past, phenomenal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<h2>MADISON<br />

THE CITY OF THE FOUR LAKES</h2>

<p class="chapby">By REUBEN G. THWAITES</p>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">I</span>N 1836, that portion of Michigan Territory
which lay west of Lake Michigan, was
erected into the Territory of Wisconsin. Within
the borders of the nascent commonwealth there
lived at that time about twelve thousand whites
and nine thousand Indians. Many of the sites
of future cities of Wisconsin were already
occupied by agricultural settlers, isolated or in
tiny groups.</p>

<p>Green Bay, a straggling French-Canadian
settlement, had come down from the seventeenth
century, maintaining a sickly existence
upon the fur trade and the coasting traffic of
the upper Great Lakes; Forts Winnebago
(at Portage) and Crawford (at Prairie du
Chien) were surrounded by meagre hamlets,
chiefly of French creoles; the lead-mining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
region in the southwest, although sparsely
settled, contained the bulk of the white population,
with Mineral Point as its centre&mdash;a
village having at the time an apparently
brighter prospect than the new settlement at
the mouth of Milwaukee River; there were also
a few notches carved, at wide intervals, from
the gloomy forest bordering the western shore
of Lake Michigan. Outside of the settlements
just enumerated, Wisconsin was practically uninhabited
by whites. Here and there was to
be found an Indian trader, the Yankee successor
of the <i>coureur de bois</i> of the old French
<i>régime</i>, or some exceptionally adventurous
farmer; but their far-separated cabins only
emphasized the density of the wilderness,
through which roamed untrammelled the shiftless,
gipsy-like aborigines,&mdash;the comparatively
harmless Chippewas, Menomonies, Pottawatomies
and Winnebagoes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_279.jpg">THE STATE HOUSE, MADISON.</a><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a></div>

<p>On the 4th of July the territorial officers
of Wisconsin qualified at Mineral Point, with
Henry Dodge, a Black Hawk War hero, as
Governor. In October following, the first
Legislature assembled within a two-story battlement-fronted
house in the little lead-region
hamlet of Belmont. The highway which it
faced bristled with stumps, while miners' shafts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
and prospectors' holes thickly dimpled the
shanty neighborhood. A month was spent in
selecting a capital for the infant Territory.
There were seventeen applicants. Some of
them were actual settlements, like Green Bay,
Fond du Lac, Milwaukee, Racine, Portage,
Belmont, Mineral Point, and Platteville; but
others were "paper towns," existing only on
maps made by real-estate speculators. Of such
shadowy substance was Madison, the victor.</p>

<p>James Duane Doty, who had been United
States Circuit Judge for the country west of
Lake Michigan, had formed a town-site partnership
with Stevens T. Mason, then Governor
of Michigan Territory. These gentlemen preempted
several tracts of government land at
presumably desirable spots in the wilderness.
Doty advanced the respective claims of these
tracts, giving them maps and attractive names.
His favorite was an undulating isthmus between
Lakes Monona and Mendota,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
heart of Southern Wisconsin, midway between
Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River.
This claimant he named "Madison," after the
third President of the United States.</p>

<p>It was freely alleged at the time that Doty
presented choice lots in Madison to his legislative
friends. However this may be, the
ostensible arguments produced were: that the
chief centres of settlement in the northeast
(Green Bay), the southeast (Milwaukee), and
the southwest (the lead region) were so widely
separated and had such divergent interests that
to select one would alienate the others and
make it impossible to harmoniously conduct
the territorial government; again, that to
build up one corner of the Territory at the
expense of the others would unequally distribute
the population; it was also urged that
the unsettled central portion of the Territory
needed the incentive to growth which the
capital would give it; and lastly, Doty, the
only man in Belmont that winter who seems
to have known Madison, declared the site to
be the most <ins class="corr" title='Correction: original text was "beautful"'>beautiful</ins> spot in the Wisconsin
forest. And thus Madison won.</p>

<p>Beyond the understanding that the centre
of the Capitol Park was to be the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
corner of four sections of land which met near
the middle of the isthmus, there had as yet
been no thought of how this projected town in
the woods should be laid out. A French half-breed,
Olivier Armel, who had a temporary
trading shanty on the tract, half brush and half
canvas, was the only man whom the surveyor
found when he arrived in a blinding snowstorm
in February (1837) to set the stakes in
this virgin wilderness for the future State House
of Wisconsin. The streets of the town were
laid out, so far as possible, upon the lines of
the national capital: wide avenues radiating
from the Capitol Park upon the points of the
compass were bisected by other highways
paralleling the shores of the two principal
lakes. For names of the thoroughfares, the
patriotic surveyor had recourse to the list of
signatures to the federal Constitution, probably
the only instance of a city's streets being exclusively
named from this venerable body of
lawgivers.</p>

<p>The first dwelling in Madison was a log
house built in April by one Eben Peck, for the
entertainment of the mechanics who were expected
out from Milwaukee to construct the
State House. It was June 10th before the build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>ing
commissioner and his thirty-six workmen
put in an appearance, after a toilsome overland
journey of ten days through rain and mud,
with no roads, and unbridged rivers which had
either to be forded or swam. On the 4th
of July the conerstone was laid "with appropriate
toasts and speeches" by a small knot of
territorial officials.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_283.jpg">THE FIRST EXECUTIVE RESIDENCE (STILL STANDING) IN USE BY
GOVERNOR DOTY.</a></div>

<p>It was January, 1839, before the territorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Legislature could be accommodated at Madison;
and even then the situation brought little
comfort. Says a pioneer of those days:
"With the session came crowds of people.
The public houses were literally crammed&mdash;shakedowns
were looked upon as a luxury, and
lucky was the guest whose fortune it was to
rest his weary limbs on a straw or hay mattress."</p>

<p>The little village was charmingly situated in
the primeval forest. One of Madison's early
teachers thus wrote of the hamlet of his young
manhood:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Those who only know of Madison now, have but a
feeble conception of its wonderful and fascinating beauty
at the beginning. In 1839 it had the look of a well-kept
lawn, shaded by fine white-oak and burr-oak trees, with
a fragrant fringe of red cedar all about the lake shores.
There was then no underbrush and thicket such as
sprung up soon, when the semi-annual fires ceased to do
the duty of the rake and mower; but the eye had a
stretch quite uninterrupted, except as the surface rose
in beautiful green knolls on either lake. The lakes then
lay in natural silver beauty, prettily framed in pebbly
beach. For simple, quiet beauty, Madison in 1839 was
unequalled by anything I remember."</p></blockquote>

<p>Despite its natural attractiveness, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
presumably favorable location, Madison was a
plant of slow growth. In the summer of 1838
the census revealed the presence here of only
sixty-two people, and it is recorded that there
were at that time "not more than a dozen
houses, built and in process of erection, counting
every cabin and shanty within three miles
of the Capitol," while Indian wigwams were
frequently set up within sight of the doors.
Four years later there were but 172 people,
and in 1846 but 632. By the close of 1850,
however, the population had, largely as the
result of a mild "boom" in that year, grown
to 1672. Five years later Horace Greeley
and Bayard Taylor paid the place a visit, and
in letters to the New York <i>Tribune</i> highly
extolled its beauties. As a result there was
an almost immediate increase of population
and a considerable advance in the price of real
estate; so that at the outbreak of the Civil
War there were 7000 Madisonians.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_286.jpg">PROFILE ROCK ON LAKE MENDOTA.</a><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></div>

<p>Notwithstanding the general prevalence of
financial stringency, Madison prospered during
the war. The State's troops were largely
mobilized here, and constantly enlivened the
streets; a great deal of money was necessarily
spent by the State and nation for supplies and
salaries, as well as by the soldiers themselves,
so that throughout it all the town grew substantially.
In 1870 there were 10,000 citizens,
but the next decade only slightly advanced
this census. About 1882, however, a variety
of causes led to the commencement of a
stronger growth&mdash;chiefly the rapid development
of the State University, the expansion of
the State's administrative affairs, the bettering
of railroad facilities, and an enlargement of
local manufacturing interests. During the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
past eighteen years there has been a steady
gain, with every indication of permanency;
the census of 1900 revealed the presence at
the Wisconsin capital of 20,000 residents,
while an additional 5000 dwell in closely abutting
suburbs.</p>

<p>Frequent attempts to remove the capital to
Milwaukee were long a potent factor in retarding
the development of Madison. In 1870
the effort was nearly successful. The fact,
however, that the State had by this time invested
large sums of money in public buildings
in and around Madison, particularly in the
State University,&mdash;which institution must, by
the terms of the constitution, be situated "at
or near the seat of State government,"&mdash;has of
late years cooled the ardor of advocates of
removal, so that no fear of renewed agitation
is now entertained.</p>

<p>In the early annals of this peaceful little city
in the undulating oak grove between Monona
and Mendota,&mdash;surrounded on every hand by
far-stretching lakes and marshes, and thus in a
measure isolated from her rural neighbors,&mdash;the
historian finds little of stirring interest;
and that little almost always the reflex of the
Legislature, which annually until 1882, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the sessions were made biennial, came and
went with much bustle and sometimes brawl.
The legislative sessions were, in ante-bellum
days, the events of the year, and attracted
prominent men from all quarters of Wisconsin.
The crude hotels were filled each winter
with legislators, lobbyists and visiting politicians.
The humors of the time were often uncouth.
There was a deal of horse-play, hard
drinking, and profanity, and occasionally a personal
encounter during the heat of discussion:
as in 1842, when Charles C.P. Arndt, of Brown,
was killed on the floor of the council chamber by
his fellow-member, James R. Vineyard, of Grant,
an event to which Dickens alluded in his
<i>American Notes</i>, and which gained for Wisconsin
an unenviable notoriety the country over.
But an undercurrent of good nature was generally
observable, and strong attachments were
more frequently noticeable than feuds.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_289.jpg">VIEW OF MADISON ACROSS LAKE MONONA.</a><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a></div>

<p>Dancing and miscellaneous merry-making
were the order of the times, and society at the
capital was, from the first, thought to be fashionable.
Even when the Legislature was not in
session, Madison long remained the social as
well as the political centre of Wisconsin, and
overland travellers between the outlying settlements
on the shores of the Mississippi and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Lake Michigan or Green Bay were wont to
tarry here upon their way. Several of them
have left us, in journals and in letters, pleasing
descriptions of their reception by the good-natured
inhabitants, and the impressions made
on them by the natural attractions of this
beauty-spot.</p>

<p>In 1856, Madison was the scene of political
excitement of a serious character. William
Barstow (Democrat) claimed to have been reelected
Governor over Coles Bashford (Republican),
by 157 majority. The Democrats
controlled the State board of canvassers, and
the Republicans claimed that this board had
tampered with the returns. Upon January
27th both Barstow and Bashford took the oath
of office, but the former and his friends continued
to hold the State House. The State
Supreme Court was called upon by Bashford,
in a <i>quo warranto</i> suit, to oust the incumbent
and give the office of Governor to the relator.
Thus commenced the most celebrated case ever
tried by this bench. This was the first time in
the history of the United States that a State
court had been called upon to decide as to the
right of a Governor to hold his seat. Its juris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>diction
was questioned by Barstow's attorneys.
The contest waged fiercely for some weeks,
with eminent counsel on both sides, the court
at last holding that it had jurisdiction. The
court then proceeded with its inquiry, and
March 24th declared that Bashford had received
a majority of 1009. A few days before this
Barstow had resigned, and Lieutenant-Governor
McArthur was holding the office by virtue
of the constitution. McArthur was defiant,
and announced his determination to hold the
post at all hazards. But the court promptly
ruled that Barstow's title being worthless, McArthur
could not, of course, succeed to it.</p>

<p>Throughout this long contest, it may well
be imagined that popular excitement in and
around Madison ran high. The respective
bands of partisans were armed and drilling, in
anticipation of a desperate encounter. It
would have taken small provocation to ignite
this tinder-box, but the management on both
sides was judicious; and although the opposing
forces had frequent quarrels, and made
numerous and vigorous threats of violence,
no blows were struck. Upon the day after
the court's decision Bashford and a bodyguard
advanced through corridors crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
with his followers, to McArthur's office, and,
showing his writ, quietly announced that he
would henceforth take charge of State affairs.
McArthur hesitated, but a glance at the threatening
crowd induced him to retire hurriedly
through the door. The friends of Bashford
cheered in triumph, and then poured into the
office to congratulate the new Governor.</p>

<p>As has been previously stated, the corner-stone
of the old territorial State House was
laid July 4, 1837. The building cost about
$60,000. An old engraving of the structure,
which we herewith reproduce, shows that it
was of the then prevalent Americanized-Greek
style of which there are still remaining a few
examples, chiefly in the Southern States; contemporary
accounts agree that it was rather
superior in character to most of the Western
capitols of sixty years ago. In 1857, the Legislature
authorized the enlargement of the capitol.
This "enlargement" was but nominal;
the plans developed into a new building on the
site of the old, to cost somewhat over half a
million dollars. Lack of funds because of the
Civil War caused the work to proceed slowly,
so that it was 1870 before the dome of the new
State House was completed. In 1882, two
new transverse wings were provided for. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the total cost of the present capitol and the
development of the surrounding park has been
about $900,000. The building is, however, now
sadly behind the times in respect of light, ventilation
and sanitary conveniences, and there
is some thought of a new State House which
shall be more nearly worthy of a rich and fast-growing
commonwealth of over two millions of
people.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_293.jpg">THE FIRST STATE HOUSE, MADISON.</a><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a></div>

<p>The University of Wisconsin was incorporated
under an act of Legislature approved
the 26th day of July, 1848; but it was
the 16th of January, 1850, before the first
chancellor was inaugurated, and the 5th of
February before the doors were opened for
the reception of pupils. During the first
twenty years of its existence, the institution
was beset with vicissitudes, and obliged to
battle against popular indifference and even
opposition. The congressional land grants
which were designed to create a fund for its
endowment were recklessly disposed of by the
legislatures of the '50's, avowedly to encourage
speedy settlement of the State, under the plea
that when the commonwealth became well
populated it would be rich enough to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the University by taxation; it was also maintained
that pioneers had little need for or
patience with higher education. Gradually,
the University gained recognition as the logical
head of the educational
system
of the State;
and at last, after
a half-century of
growth, it has
developed from
a rustic academy
of twenty students
into an
institution of
national reputation,
with a
talented faculty
giving instruction
to nearly 3000 students, assembled from
many States and countries.</p>

<div class="figleft">

<span class="caption">PROFESSOR WILLIAM FRANCIS ALLEN.</span>
</div>

<p>The University is admirably situated, chiefly
upon two hills lying a mile to the west of the
State House and commanding wide views of
the surrounding country. The grounds comprise
about 350 acres of hill and plain, the
western half of which is occupied by the build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>ings
and experimental farm of the College of
Agriculture. Mendota, the largest and most
beautiful of the chain of lakes, lies directly to
the north, its attractive shores often rising into
steep bluffs, surmounted by summer cottages,
or swelling into distant hills besprinkled with
prosperous farmsteads, while the towers and
chimneys of the State Hospital for the Insane
fret the sky-line beyond the farthest bay. A
broad straight avenue leads directly eastward
to the ridge crowned by the white dome of
the State House; while to the south the view
ordinarily ends with the silvery expanse of
Lake Monona, glistening through the trees,
but when the foliage has thinned, the southern
horizon is sufficiently extended, both from
town and university vantage-points, to comprise
the far-off waters of Lake Waubesa.
The outlook from University Hill, over-topping
the tree-embowered town, which spreads
gracefully, with up-thrust tower and dome and
steeple, over Monona Ridge, is, particularly
upon a moonlit night in summer, one of the
most charming in America; while from Observatory
Hill, just westward, one obtains a
widely extended view of lakes and forest
and purple hills which, especially under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
glow of sunset, has won the unstinted plaudits
of competent critics, some of whom have
likened it to Old World scenes far-famed in
song and story.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_295.jpg">MADISON FROM THE STATE HOUSE SHOWING UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS IN THE DISTANCE.</a><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a></div>

<p>Few of the buildings of the State University
are architecturally worthy of mention
here. The original structures were North
and South Halls, mere four-story stone boxes.
The Doric University Hall, surmounting University
Hill, and one of the early buildings,
has of recent years been greatly improved and
extended, and now has some dignity of outline
as well as historic association. The new
Engineering Building, in gray brick, is pleasing
in form and color; Science Hall and the
Gymnasium, great piles of staring red brick, are
conspicuous examples of the average college
buildings of our day; while the best one can
say of the old Library Hall, Chemical Building,
Machine Shop, and Chadbourne Hall (the
women's dormitory) is that they will continue
to serve a useful purpose until the day when
the State feels inclined to replace them with
creditable structures. Upon Observatory Hill
is the dignified Washburn Observatory, and
upon the western slope the growing mass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
buildings appertaining to the State Experimental
Farm maintained by the College of
Agriculture.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_299.jpg">UNIVERSITY HALL, STATE UNIVERSITY.</a><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a></div>

<p>At the eastern (townward) front of University
Hill, and occupying land once a part
of the campus, a building has of late been
reared by the commonwealth which not only
is far better than any of the University structures,
but quite outranks in dignity and
thoroughness of modern construction and
equipment all other buildings owned by the
State of Wisconsin. This is the home of the
library and museum of the State Historical
Society. The University library and
its accompanying seminary rooms for advanced
study, each with its special library,
occupy quarters here, but the building itself is
administered by the society, which serves as
the trustee of the State. Built in the Italian
Doric order, of Bedford sandstone, the State
Historical Library Building is massive, dignified,
and graceful, a worthy housing for one of
the most important reference libraries in
America. The Wisconsin Historical Society<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
has long ceased to be merely a feature of
Madison or of Wisconsin; it is to-day regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
as one of the foremost institutions of this
character in the country&mdash;its splendid library
of 235,000 volumes being one of the finest collections
of Americana extant, rich in maps and
manuscripts as well as books; and its publications
rank with those of the similar societies
of Massachusetts, New York, and
Pennsylvania.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_301.jpg">STATE HISTORICAL LIBRARY BUILDING.</a><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a></div>

<p>Madison is fortunate in her elementary and
secondary public schools as well as in possessing
the State University; while several admirable
private and denominational schools
have found it desirable to settle here, under
the wing of the great group of State colleges.
As is becoming in an educational centre, much
attention is here paid to church life. The
large congregations have been careful to select
for their pulpits men of prominence and ability,
fitted to attract the student mind; and the
Christian associations connected with the
State University are conducted upon a high
plane of usefulness.</p>

<p>In Madison there dwell three well-accentuated
classes of inhabitants: those relying upon
trade and industry, the State and federal officials,
and the university element, each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
them growing in numbers and importance.
There is, however, far less differentiation of interests
and aspirations than is commonly seen
in college towns. It has for many years been
the continual aim of several influential clubs,
notably the Woman's, the Literary, the Contemporary,
the Six O'clock, and the Town and
Gown,&mdash;in which both "townfolk" and "gown
folk" freely commingle,&mdash;to break down the
usual class barriers. The result is that college
men coming to Madison from other institutions
find here few of the sharp social distinctions
to which they have elsewhere become
accustomed.</p>

<p>But while town and gown are practically one
in Madison, the official class has not until
of late been conspicuous in her social life.
The brevity of political tenure, rendering the
permanent inhabitants in a measure indifferent
to the "come-and-goes," has doubtless had
much to do with this; while a contributory
element has been the fact that many State
officials, finding the cost of living at the capital
somewhat higher than in the small interior
towns, have heretofore left their families at
home. With the new statute prohibiting
public employés from using railroad passes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
transportation to and from home now forms an
important item of expense to the office holder,
and a large proportion of them are moving
their families to the seat of government. It is
fair to predict that, through the influence of
the clubs, which
have recently
taken upon
themselves the
payment of
social courtesies
to the official
class, these barriers
may in turn
be removed, as
they have between
town and
gown.</p>

<p>The native
American element in Madison
is chiefly from New York State, with a large
sprinkling of New Englanders, especially from
Vermont. Perhaps one third of the 25,000
people in this community are of German
parentage, and there is a considerable and influential
Scandinavian element, mostly Nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>wegian; numerous
other nationalities there
are, but these are the most conspicuous. Despite
this large foreign contingent, however,
and the cosmopolitan tone of university society,
the strong flavor of Vermont and New
York, originally given to this community in
the days before the Civil War, is still the dominant
characteristic in the social life of Madison.
Many discriminating visitors frequently
in their hours of first impressions, liken her
to a staid New England college town; while
others revert to some demure hill-town of Western
New York for the type which best describes
the social side of this city of the Wisconsin
lakes.</p>

<p>The railroad facilities of Madison are undoubtedly
remarkable for a town of its size;
these are attracting wholesale houses and
warehousemen, and new factories are talked
of. The existing industries employ some
fifteen hundred men. The schools, the university,
the unusual library facilities and the
beauty and healthfulness of the town bring to
it an ever-increasing accession of cultured people
with moderate fixed incomes. Summer
visitors from St. Louis, New Orleans, and
other southern cities of the Mississippi Valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
are encouraged to come to the Four Lakes.
The comfort of the inhabitants is greatly enhanced
by a system of macadamized streets
which is relatively the best in Wisconsin; and
there is also maintained, by popular subscription,
a labyrinth of twenty-five miles of suburban
drives, enriched by the art of the
landscape gardener, and leading to favorite
view-points. A "Forty Thousand Club" is
strenuously seeking to exploit and double the
material interests of the town, within the present
decade. But when all is said, Madison's
distinguishing characteristics, as well as her
neighborhood gossip, will probably long remain
such as properly pertain to the political
and educational centre of a rapidly developing
commonwealth.</p>

<h2>MINNEAPOLIS&mdash;ST. PAUL<br />

THE TWIN CITIES</h2>

<p class="chapby">By CHARLES B. ELLIOTT</p>

<blockquote><p>"We are citizens of two fair cities," said a Genoese gentleman to
a Florentine artist, "and if I were not a Genoese I should wish to be
a Florentine." "And I," replied the artist, "if I were not Florentine&mdash;"
"You would wish to be a Genoese," said the other. "No,"
replied the artist, "I should wish to be Florentine."</p></blockquote>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">W</span>ITHIN a circle with a radius of ten
miles, enclosing the Falls of St. Anthony,
are two modern cities with a population of almost
four hundred thousand. The pioneer
settler died a few months ago and the first
child born there is now but passing middle life.
And yet a little more than half a century after
the landing of the Pilgrims the cross of Christ
and the arms of France were carved on an oak
tree which stood on the site of the present city
of Minneapolis.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1680 Louis Hennepin, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Recollet monk, in company with Michael
Accault and a Picard named Du Gay first explored
the Upper Mississippi. Hennepin
wrote a famous description of his travels, and
gave the name to the falls he had discovered.
But La Salle, Hennepin's fellow-voyager
across the Atlantic, was the first to write a description
of the Falls of St. Anthony, from
information which must have been furnished
by one of Hennepin's party.</p>

<p>For almost a century after Hennepin no
white man visited the Falls of St. Anthony.
In 1776, Captain Jonathan Carver, of Connecticut,
started on an exploring expedition, to the
Northwest and reached the falls about the middle
of November. Carver made the first picture
of the falls and gives an accurate
description, from which it appears that the
island which is now many feet below the waterfall
was then in its midst. Carver greatly appreciated
the beauty of the country, but, like
Hennepin, passed away leaving only his description
and his picture. The War of the
Revolution came and left no trace on the
Northwest. At its close the sovereignty of
France and of the new nation which had been
born into the world faced each other on the<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
banks of the Mississippi. In 1803 the west as
well as the east bank became part of the domain
of the United States. But the inhabitants
knew nothing of the change until Captain
Zebulon M. Pike, of the army, came to put an
end to alleged improper transactions on the
part of certain British traders. On an island a
few miles below the falls Pike held a council
with the Sioux and signed a treaty which extinguished
the Indian title to a tract of land extending
nine miles on each side of the river
north from the mouth of the Minnesota River,
and including the Falls of St. Anthony. Twelve
years later Major Long, with two grandsons
of Carver, ascended the river from St. Louis in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
a six-oared skiff, and wrote that "the murmuring
of the cascade, the roaring of the river and
the thunder of the cataract all contribute to
render the scene the most interesting and magnificent
of any I ever before witnessed."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_309.jpg">THE FALLS OF ST. ANTHONY ABOUT 1850.</a><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a></div>

<p>About 1811 the philanthropic Earl of Selkirk
attempted to establish a colony in the Red
River Valley. Six years later it was threatened
by starvation. The noble Earl then
visited the country, and his presence caused so
much disquietude in the breasts of the Indian
agents that, fearing improper foreign influence
over the Indians, they induced the Government
to establish a military post in the country. In
August, 1819, Colonel Leavenworth, with
ninety-eight soldiers of the Fifth Infantry,
pitched their tents near the mouth of the Minnesota
River, about eight miles below the falls.
A year later, Colonel Snelling, who had succeeded
to the command, built the fort on the
bluff where it now stands, and gave it the name
of Fort St. Anthony. In 1824 General Scott
suggested to the War Department the propriety
of changing the name of the fort to that of one
whose services to the country had been more
conspicuous than those of Father Hennepin's
patron saint.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_311.jpg">TOWER AT FORT SNELLING.
THE ORIGINAL "FORT" NOW USED AS A GUARD-HOUSE.</a><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a></div>

<p>In 1821 the soldiers built a mill on the west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
side of the river, near where now stands one
of the greatest flouring mills in the world.
The fort was, of course, the centre of what
life there was in the country, and its people
occasionally came into contact with the great
world beyond. In 1826 the Indian agent,
Major Taliafero, officiated at the marriage of
the slave, Dred Scott, who was destined to
play a part in history doubtless out of all
proportion to his expectations. Colonel Snelling's
son Joseph was something of a <i>littérateur</i>,
and, after fighting a duel with a young
officer, he became involved in a more savage,
although less bloody, contest with N.P.
Willis.</p>

<p>The land about the falls was a military
reservation and therefore not open to settlement.
As early as 1837 a Swiss watchmaker
by the name of Perry attempted to settle
there, but was driven off by the soldiers.
Going a few miles down the river, he became
in 1838, the first settler upon the present site
of the city of St. Paul. His only competitor
for this honor is a certain one-eyed personage
of evil disposition and unattractive appearance
whose true name was Parrant, but who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
became known to fame as Pig's Eye. With an
eye to the advantages of the liquor business,
Parrant located his claim beyond the limits of
the reservation and near the river, where it became
a flourishing resort for soldiers, Indians,
and other frontier characters. It was the head
of navigation on the river and entered into
competition with the neighboring village of
Stillwater for the proud position of the metropolis
of the Territory. A town near by was
surveyed in 1847 and during the following
two years, as we are credibly informed by a
local historian, "maturative and creative influence,
slowly but surely tended towards civilization."
From the same source we learn that
in 1848 "the <i>nuclei</i> of civilization" consisted
of a church, a school, and a hotel,&mdash;surely not
a bad beginning. The history of the modern
city properly begins in 1848, when Minnesota
was organized as a territory with St. Paul as
the provisional capital. The territorial government
was organized with Alexander
Ramsey (afterwards Governor of the State,
Senator, and Secretary of War) as Governor,
and duly proclaimed on June 1, 1848. The
enabling act named St. Paul as the temporary
capital, but left the people free to choose at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
first general election a permanent place of
government.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illo_314.jpg" width="200" alt="" title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">ALEXANDER RAMSEY.</span>
</div>

<p>In the meantime, a rival town had grown up
at the east end of the Falls of St. Anthony,
and the long
struggle for supremacy
began
with the selection
of a permanent
capital.
The Indian title
to the lands was
extinguished in
1838, but two
years earlier
the commandant
at the fort, Major
Plympton,
availed himself
of his superior
facilities and
staked out a claim and built a cabin near the
east end of the falls. Other claims were located
soon after, all of which ultimately became the
property of Franklin Steele and Pierre Bottineau,
names famous in the early history of the
locality. Early in 1847 there were about fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
people in the village, but in that year the van
of "that great army which is moving yet but
never stopping" began to arrive.</p>

<p>In 1848 three hundred people were on the
ground, and the two towns of St. Anthony City
and St. Anthony were duly surveyed and
launched upon the market. In the same year
it is interesting to find the names of Robert
Rantoul and Caleb Cushing, famous statesmen
of the day, among the purchasers of a
nine-tenths interest in the east-side water
power. During this year both the villages of
St. Anthony and St. Paul were thriving under
the impulse given by the organization of a
regular government. St. Anthony now obtained
a post-office, established a library association
with two hundred books on its shelves,
and indulged in a lecture course by local talent.
St. Paul became the capital, but the controversy
was not finally settled until 1872, when
a compromise was effected by the permanent
location of the State University at Minneapolis.
The growth of the two villages during
the next decade was very rapid. In 1855
Laurence Oliphant, diplomat and traveller,
came down the river in a canoe and wrote interesting
descriptions of St. Anthony and St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Paul and uncomplimentary notices of the people
to <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>. He was charmed
with the falls and the "comfortable, civilized
aspect of the town," which was then becoming
known as a "watering place." Hotel manners
in the capital city were not satisfactory, but the
opinions of England and the Crimean War
expressed by prominent citizens in the free
and easy vernacular of the frontier made good
reading.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_317.jpg">COURT HOUSE AND CITY HALL, MINNEAPOLIS.</a><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a></div>

<p>In the meantime another village had grown
up on the west side of the falls. In 1849 the
old government mill, the little house a few
yards back and two cabins built by missionaries
on the banks of Lake Calhoun were the
only buildings on the west side of the river.
In that year Robert Smith, a member of Congress
from Illinois, through some means best
known to himself, obtained from the War Department
the privilege of purchasing the mill
and the house and of making a claim to 160
acres of land. This tract was carefully selected
for the purpose of including the valuable
waterpower rights on the west side. In the
same year John H. Stevens, then postmaster
at the fort, also obtained a permit and entered
a claim to the land now covered by the heart
of the city. While Smith and Stevens were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
favored others were driven from the reservation
by the soldiers. Stevens built the first
frame house in Minneapolis, and it now stands
in one of the beautiful parks of the city as an
evidence of the antiquity of things. Legal
titles could not be obtained on the west side
until 1855, although by that time more than
two hundred houses had been built. In the
following year the city was incorporated, but in
1862 this form of government was abandoned,
and the people lived under a simple township
organization until 1867. Five years later, in
1872, the two cities of St. Anthony and Minneapolis
were consolidated under the name of
the City of Minneapolis, which then entered
upon a period of phenomenal growth.</p>

<p>We now find two cities in the stress of a
rivalry which continued for many years. The
west line of St. Paul soon became the east line
of Minneapolis. The existence of two cities
so near together was, as we have seen, due not
to deliberate choice but to circumstances. In
early days the fall, with its abundant waterpower
and attractive scenery, was the point
about which the minds of people revolved; it
was, however, on the military reservation ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>quired
by Pike, and settlers were driven to find
a foothold farther down the river but within
reach of the fort. There were some difficulties
in the way of navigation to the falls, but these
would soon have been removed. St. Paul was
the capital of the State, and thus became the
political and professional centre. In the contest
for political honors this supremacy is still
maintained. Its leaders control the politics
of the State. Governors and senators are
created in St. Paul and not in Minneapolis.
The business enterprise of St. Paul
found vent in building up great wholesale
houses and in the development of railway and
general transportation enterprises. Minneapolis,
by reason of its location, became a great
manufacturing centre. The vast pine forests
of the north sent millions of logs to its mills.
Around the falls were built the greatest flouring
mills in the world, and its location upon
the eastern edge of the great prairies of Minnesota
and Dakota soon made it the primary
wheat market of the world. The commercial
and business interests of the two cities thus for
a number of years developed along different
and clearly defined lines. The increase of population
is shown by the following table:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>The falls was the point at which the early
thought and life of Minneapolis centred, and
the foundation of its early business prosperity.
Paul Bourget, in his <i>Outre Mer</i>, speaking of
the reasons for the location of American cities,
says, "If any feature such as a waterfall permitted
factories, industries were established.
Minneapolis had no other origin. The falls of
the Mississippi lent themselves to a series of
incomparable mills and this was the starting-point
of one of the future capitals of the world."
When the Government established a fort it took
the name of the falls, and the first town-sites
were only distinguishable from each other by
the difference between St. Anthony and St.
Anthony City.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_321.jpg">FALLS OF ST. ANTHONY, DURING HIGH WATER.</a><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a></div>

<p>When it was rumored that the waterpower
was about to be destroyed, consternation rested
upon the little community. In 1868 the historian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Parkman had written:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Great changes, however, have taken place here and
are still in progress. The rock is a very soft and friable
sandstone, overlaid by a stratum of limestone; and it is
crumbling with such rapidity under the action of the
water that the cataract will soon be little more than a
rapid.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Other changes equally disastrous in the artistic
point of view are going on even more quickly. Beside
the falls stands a city which by an ingenious combination
of Greek and Sioux languages received the name of Minneapolis,
the City of the Water, and which in 1867 contained
ten thousand inhabitants, two national banks, and
an opera house, while its rival city of St. Anthony, immediately
opposite, boasts a gigantic water cure and the State
University. In short, the great natural beauty of the
place is utterly spoiled."</p></blockquote>

<p>Minneapolis is essentially a manufacturing
city. For many years the principal industry
was the manufacture of lumber, which in its
various forms has now reached great magnitude.
The annual output for the five years
prior to 1850 was 1,500,000 feet a year. In
1870 it reached 118,500,000 feet a year; in
1880 it was 195,500,000; in 1890, 300,000,000;
in 1900 more than 500,000,000, and in addition
57,000,000 shingles and 94,000,000 laths.
An army of men is engaged in the work of
cutting the logs on the timber lands of the north.
These are driven or floated down the river to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the booms near the mills which line the river in
the northern part of the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_323.jpg">THE MILLING DISTRICT.</a><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a></div>

<p>The prominence of the city in flour-milling
is due to its location and to the skill and ingenuity
of the men who have been engaged in the
business. Minneapolis has passed through
three well-defined milling periods. Prior to
1870 the ancient process of grinding wheat between
the upper and nether millstones was in
use, which turned into middlings much of the
precious gluten. In 1872 an emigrant French
miller named Legroux devised an apparatus for
purifying middlings, and as a result the product
became famous as "Minnesota Patent Flour,"
and brought pre-eminence and wealth to the
Minnesota millers. A practical monopoly existed
until the Eastern millers discovered that
the process could be as well applied to the winter
wheat of Minnesota as to the spring. Then
began a new struggle for pre-eminence. After
searching through the world, the Minneapolis
millers discovered in Hungary a process of milling
hard wheat which finally disposed of the
ancient millstone and carried the wheat between
rolls of smooth and corrugated surface until,
by a process of gradual reduction, the desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
fineness was secured. Foremost in the work
of developing this great industry was the late
Charles A. Pillsbury, to whose enterprise the
city is greatly indebted.</p>

<p>At the present time the Minneapolis mills
can produce 76,366 barrels of flour a day,
which is the largest daily capacity of any
group of mills in the world. The flour export
for 1900 was 4,702,485 barrels. Thus
the mills of Minneapolis, if grinding steadily,
could give a loaf of bread every day to every
man, woman, and child in the States of Ohio,
Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut,
Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire,
and Maine.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_326.jpg">PUBLIC LIBRARY, MINNEAPOLIS.</a><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a></div>

<p>The conditions in a new and rapidly growing
city cannot be properly understood without
careful consideration of such material facts
as we have been considering. But there is
yet another story to tell. It is doubtful
whether any cities in the United States of the
size contain so many beautiful pictures and
fine libraries. The Minneapolis Public Library
is well known to all interested in library management
by reason of the liberality and novelty
of its methods. In the spring of 1859 Bayard
Taylor delivered a lecture in the village and<span class="pagenum">[284]</span>
gave the proceeds, less than one hundred
dollars, to a library association, which took the
name of the Minneapolis Atheneum. Later
Dr. Kirby Spencer devised to it a fund which
now yields about $8000 each year, for the
purchase of books of a certain designated
class and character. The Atheneum was not
a public library, but it was liberally managed
by the trustees and the community was en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>abled
to use it under reasonable restrictions.
The trustees finally took the lead in the
establishment of a public library into which
the collection of the Atheneum was merged.
The law created a library board with limited
powers of taxation. Public-spirited citizens
contributed a valuable site on which there was
erected a building not surpassed by any structure
of its kind in the country for convenience
and general efficiency. In addition to the
central building, there are two branch buildings,
one erected by the city and the other
presented to the city by ex-Governor John S.
Pillsbury, who had already made his name
synonymous with public generosity by his
liberal gifts to the State University. The
first librarian was Herbert Putnam, afterwards
of the Boston Public Library, and now the
Librarian of the Congressional Library at
Washington. His successor, an eminent
scholar, Dr. James K. Hosmer, has continued
building upon the foundation laid by Mr. Putnam.
The system gives to the public a much
greater liberty of access to the books than had
been considered safe and desirable in other
large libraries. The plan has been successful
and there have been no losses or injuries to the<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>
books which would justify the withdrawal or
restriction of such freedom. The library now
contains 113,000 books, and during the past
year the circulation was over 600,000, which
was an average of three books for each inhabitant
of the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_328.jpg">OLE BULL MONUMENT IN LORING PARK.</a><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a></div>

<p>The picture gallery and school of the Minneapolis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Society of Fine Arts occupies the
third floor of the Library Building. The city
owns a number of good paintings, which it
purchased at the sale of the gallery that
formerly belonged to the Exposition Company.
Several fine paintings have been presented
to the municipality by Mr. J.J. Hill of
St. Paul, whose wealth has also been used to
advance and cultivate the taste for artistic work
in the city of St. Paul. When the collection of
casts selected by General Cesnola for the Metropolitan
Museum of Art arrived in New York
before the building was ready, it was promptly
purchased by citizens of Minneapolis, and donated
to the Exposition Company, which was
then holding annual exhibits. It is now the
property of Mr. T.B. Janney, by whom it has
been placed in the Public Library, and thus for
all practical purposes dedicated to the art education
of the people. Mr. Hill in St. Paul and
Mr. T.B. Walker in Minneapolis have private
collections which include many famous and
valuable pictures.</p>

<p>A start has been made in the work of beautifying
the city and honoring illustrious citizens
by the placing of Fjelde's statue of Ole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Bull in Loring Park and Daniel C. French's
statue of ex-Governor John S. Pillsbury in the
grounds of the State University. A law has
recently been passed which provides for the
creation of permanent art commissions in St.
Paul and Minneapolis. It is hoped that these
bodies will prevent the purchase or acceptance
of unworthy pictures or statues by the
municipalities.</p>

<p>In proportion to the population the parks
in Minneapolis exceed in acreage those of any
other city in America and of all but three
foreign cities. There are twenty-two parks
and parkways, not counting numerous parklets
formed by the intersection of streets. At the
present time the park board controls 1552.81
acres. In the centre of the city lies Loring
Park, with its beautiful lake and well-kept verdure.
Starting from this point, Kenwood
Boulevard carries us along a wooded bluffy
region from whose heights are obtained changing
views of the Lake of the Isles, which is
now entirely enclosed by a boulevard. A short
half-mile south is Lake Calhoun, along the
eastern terrace of which we pass to the
borders of Lakewood Cemetery and thence
through Interlaken, rich in the beauty of its
wild woods, to the shores of Lake Harriet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and its pavilion. At the south angle of the
lake the boulevard leads off to Minnehaha
Creek, which is the outlet of Lake Minnetonka
and flows easterly through a romantic
valley until, falling over the Trenton limestone
within a half-mile of the Mississippi, it forms
the romantic Falls of Minnehaha. Around
the Falls of Minnehaha there is a park of one
hundred and twenty-five acres, containing a
zoological garden and bordered by the grounds
of the Soldiers' Home, which for all æsthetic
purposes is a part of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_331.jpg">LORING PARK&mdash;MINNEAPOLIS.</a><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a></div>

<p>Another matter of striking interest is the
bicycle-path system, which crosses the city in
every direction and extends for miles into the
country. The paths are constructed and sustained
by a license tax of fifty cents on each
wheel which uses them. During the past year
this tax produced more than $20,000, all of
which was expended in the construction and
maintenance of the paths.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_333.jpg">THE FALLS OF MINNEHAHA.</a><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a></div>

<p>The State University is the crowning feature
of the non-commercial institutions of the city
and State. The first class was graduated in
1873, and ten years thereafter the graduating
class numbered thirty-five. Its great weakness,
as of all Western institutions, was the lack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
proper preparatory schools, and President Folwell
devised a unique plan by which the State
high schools became feeders for the University.
There are now about 3500 students
in the University, making it the second or
third largest in size in the United States.
Upon the foundation broadly laid by the first
president of the institution, President Northrup
has since 1884 builded until the institution
now has a magnificent income and an equipment
second to few in the country.</p>

<p>Another notable feature in connection with
the local government in Minneapolis is her
method in dealing with the liquor question.
After a period of controversy an ordinance
was passed under which a line was drawn
around the downtown district. Within this patrol
limit saloons can exist upon the payment
of a license fee of $1000 a year. As a result,
the residence part of the city is entirely free
from the demoralizing influence of the saloon.</p>

<p>In a general way the difference in population
expresses the present relation between
the two cities in other respects. In appearance
St. Paul is more metropolitan than
Minneapolis, as it is more compactly built.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
St. Paul lies along the side of a steep bluff.
It is rugged and diverse and has the narrow
streets and crowded appearance of a large
city. From the crest of the hills, many magnificent
residences look down upon the river.
Westwardly the city straggles over the rolling
country until it reaches the Minneapolis line,
enclosing in the meantime the State Fair
Grounds and centres of population which
were originally separate municipalities, such
as St. Anthony Park, Merriam Park, and Hamline.
Minneapolis is built upon an almost
level plain, lying between the river and Lake
Calhoun, broken toward the north by a line of
high ground parallel with and a mile west of
the river. Its streets are broad and the houses
set well back in ample grounds. Enclosed
grounds are the exception. In St. Paul the
fashionable residences are largely concentrated
upon the crest of the bluff, while in Minneapolis
they are scattered in various localities.
There is also a general lack of concentration
in the business districts of Minneapolis, which
does not exist in St. Paul.</p>

<p>St. Paul's wholesale trade, if we exclude lumber
and flour, is greater than that of Minneapolis.
It is also the head of practical navigation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
on the Mississippi and the railway centre of
the Northwest, although all trains reach both
cities. The Minneapolis and St. Louis and the
"Soo" are the only railways with headquarters
in Minneapolis, while St. Paul is the headquarters
of the Chicago and Great Western and of
the great transcontinental lines, the Northern
Pacific and the Great Northern.</p>

<p>The electric street-railway system in both
cities is owned by one company, but the business
is conducted in each city under a local
management. There are 150 miles of track in
Minneapolis, and 123 in St. Paul. Two busy
interurban lines connect the centres of the two
cities. The public-school systems are of the
same general character and stand well the comparison
with those of other cities. St. Paul has
many children in the parochial schools. Her
park system is extensive and beautiful and comprises
about 1100 acres. The most extensive
is Como Park, which lies in the interurban district
and is a popular resort for thousands of
people during the summer months. St. Paul
has a large number of successful denominational
educational institutions, such as Macallister
College and Hamline University. The
most conspicuous building in the city is the
new white marble capitol now being erected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
by the State at an expense of over $3,000,000.
The St. Paul Public Library is not equal to that
of Minneapolis, but her citizens have the advantage
of the use of the library of the
Minnesota Historical Society, which is the
miscellaneous State library.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_337.jpg">THE CAPITOL, ST. PAUL.</a><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a></div>

<p>A great deal of nonsense has been written
about the characteristics of the people of these
two cities. To render the situation more interesting
and romantic all manner of inherent
racial and sociological differences have been
invented. Their struggle for supremacy has
been described as exceeding in bitterness the
ancient rivalry of Hooks and Kabbeljaws.
Nothing could be further from the truth. The
municipal and commercial rivalry was natural
and beneficial, and was ordinarily kept within
reasonable bounds. Both cities bounded upward
under the impulse thus given to energy
and enterprise. Each without the other would
itself be less. The people are of the same
type,&mdash;restless, ambitious empire builders.
They have striven mightily and manfully in
business and politics, but mingled amicably in
social intercourse. What differences in character
do exist are largely due to the different race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
elements which compose the population. If
God sifted three kingdoms to obtain the seeds
with which to plant New England, he resifted
New England and the kingdoms for the planting
of the Northwest. The present population
is diverse, but the <ins class="corr" title='Correction: Text was "predominent"'>predominant</ins> element is
the old Saxon blood.</p>

<p>For purposes of comparison, Ramsey
County is St. Paul, and Hennepin County is
Minneapolis. By the State census of 1895,
Ramsey County had 147,537 inhabitants, of
which 140,292 were in St. Paul; Hennepin
County had 217,798 inhabitants, of which 192,833
were in Minneapolis. Bearing this proportion
in mind, the following table, which gives
the nativity of the population of the counties,
is of interest:</p>

<table border="0" summary="">
<tr><td></td><td align="center">Ramsey.</td><td>Hennepin.</td></tr>

<p>This does not show the number of the descendants
of such foreign born residents now
in the counties who are included under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
head of native born. It appears that the percentage
of native born is much larger in
Minneapolis than in St. Paul. Thus, Ramsey
County with 70,261 less population, had 1129
more Irish and 5256 more Germans than Hennepin
County. In Hennepin, the Norwegians
and Swedes form a large element. St. Paul
with its German and Irish born citizens, is
Democratic in politics and strongly Roman
Catholic in religion, while in Minneapolis the
Scandinavians and Republicans predominate.
The sons of Maine, Vermont, New York, and
Ohio maintain flourishing societies, but are
completely eclipsed by the sons of Norway,
Sweden, and Denmark. They are everywhere,
in all positions and all kinds of business, from
the highest to the lowest. Coming of the old Germanic
stock, they take to self-government and
officeholding as deftly as the sons of the town
meeting. At present it is not a homogeneous
people but an aggregation of all the elements,&mdash;a
seething cauldron of the races, the residuum
of which we believe will be a type of genuine
American citizenship, broadened and liberalized
by the ancestral outlook upon the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_341.jpg">A CALM EVENING.</a><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a></div>

<p>It is fashionable at present to speak lightly
of Buckle's theory of the influence of climate
upon the character of a people, but it is certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
that we cannot understand the development
of a people unless we know something
of the climatic conditions under which they
live. The northwestern climate is much better
than the reputation it succeeded in establishing
in the early days before the blizzard centre
moved eastward. While not strictly like that
described in the old hymn,</p>

<p class="cen">
"December as pleasant as May,"
</p>

<p class="noin">there are few pleasanter localities in which to
spend the entire year. It is a climate for
thinking and doing. Spring and autumn are
delightful beyond the power of description,
and the heat of midsummer is tempered by
the myriad lakes which dot the surrounding
country. In midwinter the thermometer takes
an occasional downward plunge which sadly
disarranges the record of averages, but for
four days out of every five between December
and March the sun shines gloriously through
an atmosphere of mountain brilliancy. Then
there is in the air a hidden food of life, upon
which has fed the strenuous race of men which
within the short space of one life has builded
two great cities where none were before.</p>

<h2>DES MOINES<br />

IOWA'S CAPITAL CITY</h2>

<p class="chapby">By FRANK I. HERRIOTT</p>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">T</span>HE beginnings of the city of Des Moines
are not shrouded in romance or shadowy
tradition. Thrilling episode and epoch-making
events do not abound in her history.
Cannon have never thundered against the
gates of the city, nor hostile armies marched
and counter-marched within her environs.
Not even the blood-curdling war-whoop of the
Indian ever struck terror into the hearts of her
pioneers. Yet the story of the capital city of
Iowa is neither prosaic nor uninteresting. Her
origin and early history typify the beginnings
of civilized life throughout almost the entire
State of Iowa; and since the seat of government
was transferred to the city in 1857, her
history is in epitome the history of the great
commonwealth of which she is the capital.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>The origin of the city's name is a moot
question among antiquarians. Popular etymology
has derived <i>Des Moines</i> from the
early associations of Trappist monks at or
near the mouth of the river,&mdash;<i>la rivière des
Moines</i>: but Dr. Elliot Coues regarded this
as spurious etymology. Some local historians
have contended that the name arose from the
fact that the valley of the Des Moines River
was inhabited by the Mound Builders: numerous
mounds were found in what is now the
heart of the city; hence, the "river of the
mounds." The French explorer Nicollet ascribes
its origin to the Algonquin name <i>Moingoinan</i>,
and the earliest map showing the
journeys and discoveries of La Salle, Joliet,
and Marquette designate the river by the Algonquin
name. In later times the French
<i>voyageurs</i> and traders clipped the word, for we
find <i>Des Moins</i>, <i>De Moin</i>, <i>De Moyen</i>, <i>Demoin</i>,
<i>Demoir</i> and sometimes <i>Demon</i>. The French
settlers probably had in mind the great "middle
region" between the Mississippi and the
Missouri when they referred to the <i>De Moyen</i>
or <i>Des Moines</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_345.jpg">FORT DES MOINES IN 1844.</a><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a></div>

<p>The city of Des Moines was originally a
frontier fort. Unlike the majority of such in
the West in early days, this outpost at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
"forks of the Raccoon" was not established to
protect the whites from the Indians. On the
contrary, Fort Des Moines was founded to
guard the Sac and Fox Indians, to secure
them in the peaceful possession of their hunting-grounds
and to protect them against rapacious
land agents, the encroachments of the
whites and the bloody Sioux. And the event
was typical of the relations of the national Government
with the Indian tribes of Iowa.</p>

<p>When Iowa became known to the people of
the East the tide of emigration soon began to
run high and strong toward the Mississippi.
It is not extravagant to say that never have
more beautiful lands been opened for human
settlement than lay beyond the "Father of
Waters" in the hunting-grounds of the Sacs
and Foxes. "<i>Une ravissante contrée</i>" exclaimed
in 1842 King Louis Philippe's son, Prince de
Joinville, as he gazed upon the gorgeous green
of the river bluffs, forests, and valleys, and
meadows and prairies of Iowa. The wonderful
stories related of the marvellous fertility of
the soil and the attractiveness of nature in
this Western Mesopotamia gave a tremendous
impetus to emigration. But the national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Government firmly held back the tide. The
Mississippi was patrolled by troops to prevent
the settlers invading the lands. Colonel Zachary
Taylor and Lieutenant Jefferson Davis,
both later to achieve great fame, were among
those who guarded the rights of the Iowa Indians
and ejected overzealous frontiersmen and
"squatters." But the pressure of population
westward was irresistible; and small pretexts
were sufficient to break down the barriers.
The war with the Sacs and Foxes under their
great leader, Black Hawk, came on and by the
treaty of 1832, known as the "Black Hawk
Purchase," negotiated by General Winfield
Scott, a tract along the Mississippi fifty miles
wide was opened for settlement. This strip
was rapidly populated and in 1836 the Keokuk
reserve was ceded to the United States. In
1837 a large tract adjacent on the west, aggregating
1,250,000 acres, was purchased from the
Indians. In a short time the settlers began to
clamor for the opening of the beautiful lands
in the Des Moines Valley and beyond, and to
petition Congress; and on October 11, 1842,
Governor John Chambers, the second Territorial
governor of Iowa, negotiated a treaty at
Agency City which obtained title to the rest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Iowa. By its terms the Sacs and Foxes were
permitted to remain three years in their beloved
hunting-grounds before their departure
for Kansas. It was the latter provision that
led to the establishment of Fort Des Moines.</p>

<p>In May, 1834, a military camp styled Fort
Des Moines was established at the mouth of
the river near where Keokuk now is, but abandoned
in 1837. As early as 1835 Lieutenant-Colonel
Stephen W. Kearny had been ordered
by the War Department at Washington to
"proceed up the river Des Moines to the Raccoon
fork" and reconnoitre with a view to the
selection of a military post. He reported adversely,
however, believing that a fort should
be established farther north near the Minnesota
line; and nothing was done until the
treaty of 1842 was ratified. Then General
Scott, in order to protect the Indians from molestation
by the whites, directed that troops be
stationed near the Agency buildings then located
a few miles south and east of the present
city. Captain James Allen of the First
Dragoons selected the "forks of the Raccoon,"
and in May, 1843, a steamboat came up
the Des Moines River and landed soldiers and
supplies. The soldiers set about building the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
fort, which, when completed, consisted simply
of the officers' and men's quarters, one-story
log huts with puncheon floors, a storehouse,
hospital, and stables, all so arranged as to form
a right angle, the sides of which ran parallel
to the banks of
the converging
rivers, and came
to a point at
their junction.
There was no
stockade, embankment,
or
outlying moat
on the exposed
view or any
other protective
feature.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illo_349.jpg" width="200" alt="" title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">KEOKUK AT THE AGE OF 67.
FROM A DAGUERROTYPE TAKEN IN 1847.</span>
</div>

<p>During the
time the fort
was garrisoned
there were a few
whites permitted
to occupy
lands near by,&mdash;a representative of the American
Fur Company, traders, a tailor, a blacksmith,
and gardeners, persons who served the fort in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
some way,&mdash;but the population never exceeded
two hundred, soldiers and all. Captain Allen
and his dragoons had to give all their time to
restraining restless bands of Indians and
crowding back the eager settlers who were on
the eastern boundaries of the purchase awaiting
the departure of the Indians. The latter,
although they manifested a disinclination to
leave their old haunts, and trouble was anticipated
when the order came for them to move,
nevertheless peacefully withdrew under their
great chief Keokuk.</p>

<p>Even before the Indians' title to the lands
had expired many whites had slipped over
the borders, dodged the dragoons, spied out
the most desirable places for settlement and
determined to claim them as soon as they
could be entered. Many a story is told of
men roosting high in trees for days to keep
out of the sight of the troops. On the night
of October 10, 1845, men were stationed in all
directions from the fort ready to measure off
their claims. Precisely at twelve o'clock, midnight,
a signal gun was fired at the Agency
house. Answering guns rang out sharply in
quick succession from hilltop and valley for
miles around. The moon was shining dimly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
and its beams ill supplemented the fitful gleams
of the settlers' torches as they hastily made
their rough surveys, marked by blazing trees
or by setting stones or stakes. Men helped
each other. Two friends would run in two
directions and each fire a gun when the terminus
was reached. When the sun came up
a new empire had come into being and the
order and industry of the white man had displaced
the listless, unprogressive life of the
savage.</p>

<p>The rush of the settlers into the region
about Des Moines ahead of the surveyor's
chain led to the development of an institution
of peculiar interest in Western history. Not
only was it unique, it was also a striking instance
of the spontaneous growth of an institution
of government. It was almost if not
quite the realization under almost ideal conditions
of the theory of Jean Jacques Rousseau
that Government arises from and rests on a
Social Compact. It was known as a Land
Club or League or Claim Association, and it
played a large part in the organization of government
in Iowa. It overrode the law of the
land, or rather it blocked the natural course of
the law; yet at the same time it maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
order and secured under strict regulations
equity for the early settlers when the enforcement
of the law would have worked harsh injustice,
and possibly have produced serious
outbreaks against national authority.</p>

<p>When Iowa was first opened for settlement
the pioneers could not preempt lands or
secure title to them until they were surveyed;
and then only at public sale. But the surveyor
lagged far behind the pioneer, who considered
not the law, but, anxious for a home,
hurried into the new tracts and settled on his
claim. The "squatter" had no legal title to
his claim, nor could he obtain it by priority of
occupancy; and he knew that any stranger or
speculator with a longer purse string could purchase
his land and oust him and his family the
moment the Government should offer it for
sale. It was the likelihood of this dire contingency
that led to the formation of Claim
Clubs or Associations in nearly every locality
in Iowa. These clubs were composed of all
the settlers in a township or county. They
adopted a constitution, elected officers and
conducted their affairs by definite procedure.
They governed all matters relating to the
amount and character of claims, their occu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>pancy,
improvement, abandonment, transfers,
and disputes. The decisions of the club were
rigidly enforced. Claims were recorded and
the members were under solemn agreement
not only to guard each other from interference
but to prevent lands claimed from being sold
to strangers at the public sales. Unhappy
was the fate of a man who had the temerity to
"jump" a claim or to outbid a claimant. Tar
and feathers or unceremonious banishment or
even harsher treatment was not unlikely. At
the sale the club selected a member who
would bid in the members' claims. He was accompanied
by a posse whose presence always
prevented outsiders from bidding as the law
contemplated. If the Government officials
were not always in sympathy with the settlers,
at least they were always discreet enough to
manifest no disapproval of the proceedings.</p>

<p>These Claim Clubs of Iowa aroused fierce
opposition in the East. Calhoun and Clay
denounced them as "conspiracies of lawless
men" who so terrorized would-be purchasers
that bona fide sales were impossible, and they
urged that vigorous measures be taken to
abate them. Webster came to the settlers' defence.
He pleaded for what he called their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
"reasonable rights" under the circumstances.
The Government had delayed the surveys;
yet the settlers had been encouraged to go
into the new lands and make their homes; to
dispossess them would work severe hardship;
the clubs, although outside the pale of the law,
had enforced order and maintained to a marked
degree all the forms of law and government,
and violence was extremely rare. To Webster's
eloquence was due the passage of the
early preemption laws. They were not liberal
enough, however, and in 1848 a strong Claim
Club was formed at Des Moines.</p>

<p>Although the treaty of 1842 opened the
lands in 1845 they were not surveyed until
1847 and title could not be obtained until late
in 1848. Meantime claims in large numbers had
been entered. In 1848 speculators and "landsharks"
came in and roamed about regarding
the settlers' claims with envious and designing
eyes. Fear of them was a leading motive in the
formation of the Claim Club of 1848. Strangers
were closely watched. Any suspicious action
led to the suspect being warned that discretion
was the better part of valor. There were
some disturbances but none were serious.
The most notable arose within the club itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
One Perkins jumped his neighbor Flemmings's
claim. The latter appealed to his club members.
A "war" ensued in which Perkins narrowly
escaped hanging. When the sale took
place at Iowa City, 125 miles east of Des
Moines, the club's agent bid in at $1.25 all of
the claims and soon thereafter the club ceased
to play any part in the life of the community.</p>

<p>The first local government to which the inhabitants
of Des Moines were subject was the
county government of Polk County provided
for by the Territorial Legislature in January,
1846. The town government was not organized
until 1851. By this time Fort Des Moines
had become a thriving place. It was an important
way station on one of the main stage
routes to the West. In 1852, the establishment
of a Government land office brought to the
town for the entry of lands the multitudes of
speculators and settlers then rushing into
Western Iowa. In the days of the gold fever
and during the border wars in Kansas and
Nebraska her ferries and hostelries did a
bustling trade.</p>

<p>In those early days life was free, easy,
simple, and buoyant. The population of
Fort Des Moines was made up of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
from both Southern and Northern States.
They lived in log huts or simple frame buildings.
Pork and "corn-dodgers," coffee, sometimes
made of parched corn, and tea, often
made from native plants, constituted in the
main their diet. They had to go many miles
to get their flour ground. Oxen were generally
used in drawing wagons and ploughs.
Stage coaches were the common carriers until
the railroads entered the city in 1866. Prior
to 1858 the State constitution prohibited the
establishment of banks of note issue and the
money of the citizens was chiefly "wildcat"
and "red dog" currency. In 1857-58 the
City Council so far trenched on the powers of
Congress as to issue "City Scrip," with the
twofold object of paying the city's debt and
affording the citizens a circulating medium.
As the scrip did not become popular, in a short
time the city called in its paper and redeemed
it. Like most frontier towns a certain reckless
disregard of the sober customs of the
Eastern cities characterized the social life.
Sunday was a sort of gala day, when horse and
foot races between whites and Indians, accompanied
by more or less gambling and carousal,
were not infrequent. But the garish and reckless
life soon gave place to the staid habits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
well-ordered communities, and since the Civil
War Des Moines has justly sustained the
reputation of a "conservative" Western city.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_357.jpg">IOWA SOLDIERS AND SAILORS MONUMENT.</a><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a></div>

<p>The navigation of the Des Moines River
was a great factor in the first years of the city's
growth. Steamboats came up the river from
Keokuk in the spring and summer months
and brought most of the city's supplies. The
people living along its course soon perceived
that the river could be made a great waterway
for commerce. Those were the days of "internal
improvements." Congress was induced
in 1846 to give to the new State every
alternate section of unsold land in a strip
five miles wide on either bank of the river
to be used for the improvement of the channel.
A River Improvement Company was
formed. River traffic increased rapidly and
the people went wild over the project. As
usual the matter soon drifted into politics and
decided the fate of political parties. Demagogism
ran riot. A story is told of two
candidates for Congress in 1850, campaigning
together, who rushed across a field to greet a
farmer. The first one to reach him, extending
his hand, cried:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurrah for river improvement!"</p>

<p>The farmer so eagerly sought proved to be
a scarecrow.</p>

<p>The net result of all the excitement and speculation
attending the various efforts to improve
the river was failure and collapse. The State
after expending immense sums abandoned the
task in 1862. Worse still, complications arose
over the extent of the grant from the Government,
and left the people above the city a sorry
heritage of costly litigation that continued till
1892 over the titles to their homes. The
entire experiment was an instructive illustration
of the futility of most of the attempts at
"internal improvements" fostered by congressional
land grants.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1894 the river achieved
notoriety in connection with the epidemic of
"Commonweal Armies" that disturbed the
public that year. One division, mobilized at
San Francisco under a "General" Kelley,
when it reached Council Bluffs was refused
transportation by the Iowa railroads. The
horde then marched overland, levying on communities
for provisions, reaching Des Moines
Sunday evening, April 29th. The citizens, in
much trepidation, lodged the tramps in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
abandoned stove factory. The people were
frantic to pass them along, for their sojourn
threatened plague, pilfering, and multitudinous
evils. But the tramps refused to walk farther.
The citizens were in despair. Finally some
genius suggested that the army be floated down
the river. The "General" agreed to evacuate
the stove works when the fleet of flatboats was
ready to launch. On May 9th, amid general
rejoicing, Kelley and his army floated away.
The <i>voyageurs</i> reached the Mississippi only to
suffer ignominious discomfiture.</p>

<p>In ante-bellum days the subject of slavery
made life and politics keenly interesting in
Des Moines. Many stanch Southerners and
not a few abolitionists generated an electrical
atmosphere. The first resident Governor,
James W. Grimes, who later brought Iowa
fame in the United States Senate, spoke out
strongly against the arrogance of the slaveholders
and the border outrages. The city was
on John Brown's "underground railway," and
the spiriting of slaves through the town gave
zest to public discussion. When Brown came
through with the slaves he had captured in
Missouri he stopped over night, February 16,
1859, with James C. Jordan, a State senator.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
The next day his ferriage was paid by the editor
of the <i>State Register</i>, John Teesdale. One
of Brown's most trusted companions, who died
by his side when Lieutenant Robert E. Lee
recaptured Harper's Ferry, was a Des Moines
boy, Jeremiah
G. Anderson,
who had joined
Brown's forces
in Kansas in
1857.</p>

<span class="caption">GOVERNOR SAMUEL J. KIRKWOOD.</span>
</div>

<p>One of the
most dramatic
incidents in
Iowa history
grew out of the
ill-fated expedition
against
Harper's Ferry.
With Brown
were Edwin and Barclay Coppoc, of Springdale
Ia., the Quaker village where the conspirators
were drilled. Edwin was captured and hanged.
Barclay escaped and after exciting adventures
in Maryland and Pennsylvania got back to
Springdale, where the entire community armed
to prevent his capture by the Virginia author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>ities.
On January 23, 1860, an agent of Governor
Letcher, of Virginia, called on Governor
Samuel J. Kirkwood with a requisition for
young Coppoc. Kirkwood discovered flaws in
the papers, among them that no indictment had
been found or crime charged, and he refused
to honor the requisition. The agent became
excited. Just then two members of the Assembly,
Ed. Wright and B.F. Gue, came into the
Governor's room, overheard the conversation
with the agent, and discovered his object.
They left and immediately dispatched a messenger
to Springdale to warn Coppoc, who was
hurried off to Canada. Slavery sympathizers
in the Legislature soon heard of the matter
and introduced a resolution calling on Kirkwood
for an explanation of his proceedings.
He sent in a ringing message in which he said:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Permit me to say in conclusion that one of the most
important duties of the official position I hold is to see
that no citizen of Iowa is carried beyond her border
and subjected to the ignominy of imprisonment and the
perils of trial for crimes in another State otherwise than
by due process of law. That duty I shall perform...."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the uncertain days preceding the Civil
War, when the friends of liberty in the North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
were timid, Kirkwood's message had the effect
of a tocsin call.</p>

<p>When Sumter was fired on and President
Lincoln called for troops, Simon Cameron, Secretary
of War, telegraphed Kirkwood that one
regiment was expected from Iowa. The Governor
was not then in the city. The messenger
who carried the telegram from Davenport to
Iowa City found him out on his farm working
in a field. On reading the message he musingly
asked:</p>

<p>"Why, the President wants a whole regiment
of men! Do you suppose that I can
raise as many as that?"</p>

<p>Within a few days ten regiments were offered
him. Iowa sent nearly 79,000 men to the
front, who played a conspicuous part in the
great struggle. Des Moines contributed her
full share; among the number three became
generals, one, M.M. Crocker, being an especially
brilliant officer under Grant in the campaigns
in the West.</p>

<p>The history of the Western States is rife
with struggles over the location of county seats
and State capitals, the incidents of which are
often picturesque and exciting. The selection
of Des Moines as the capital city of Iowa was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
an important event in her history. Largely in
consequence thereof the city has become not
only the metropolis of the State but its chief
nerve centre too.</p>

<p>Iowa's first territorial capital was Burlington.
From 1841 to 1857 it was at Iowa City, when
the State archives were moved to Des Moines.
The change was not made without a spirited
contest, the marks of which are seen to-day in
the State's constitution. For, in order to placate
the people of Iowa City and secure permanency
for the arrangement, the constitutional
convention of 1857 inserted the provision that
the State University should forever remain at
Iowa City, and the capital at Des Moines,&mdash;a
piece of log-rolling not unlike that resorted
to by Alexander Hamilton when the national
capital was located at Washington. There was
a deal of politics and dissension in Des Moines
over the selection of the site of the capitol; so
much indeed that the animosities then engendered
exercise a baneful influence in dividing
the city even now. A superb site was chosen
on a high hill in East Des Moines whence one
can look over the hills and dales of the river
valleys for miles around. The first capitol was
a plain three-story brick structure, donated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
the citizens of the east city as a part of the inducement
to the commission to locate where
they did. After the Civil War the building
became inadequate; the ravages of time rendered
it unfit for a repository of the State's precious
papers; and the people of Des Moines
began to agitate for the erection of a capitol
commensurate with the needs and dignity of
the State. Thereupon followed a contest
whose incidents were most interesting and
instructive.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illo_366.jpg" width="200" alt="" title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">HON. JOHN A. KASSON.</span>
</div>

<p>The urgent need of a new capitol was generally
admitted. But the justness or propriety
of a measure is not alone sufficient to secure
legislation. The jealousy of rival towns was
fanned into fierce opposition. Their representatives
fought an appropriation with tooth and
nail. Two million dollars was magnified into
unheard-of proportions. Time-serving politicians
who admitted privately that the State
needed a capitol badly, tore passion to tatters
in portraying the poverty and distress of the
taxpayers. With a State "full of barefooted
women and barefooted children" they <ins class="corr" title='Correction: text was assevertated'>asseverated</ins>
such an expenditure would be criminal.
Such "politics" long prevailed. In 1867,
the people of Des Moines elected to the House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
of Representatives, Hon. John A. Kasson, to
conduct the fight for the appropriation. No
better man could have been chosen. He had
attained distinction as Assistant Postmaster-General
under
President
Lincoln, and
as a member
of Congress.
With what
tact, patience
and diplomacy
he carried on
the contest his
career since as
our country's
envoy to the
courts of Austria
and Germany
indicates.
For five years
Mr. Kasson struggled with recalcitrant representatives
through trying vicissitudes before
he got the appropriation. As it was,
he escaped defeat by but one vote to spare,
and that vote he would have lost but for the
timely aid of a Catholic priest, Father Brazil,
of the city. The opposition resorted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
rascally ruse of getting a bibulous member who
was friendly to the measure dead drunk and
locking him up to prevent his attendance at
the time of the vote. On being informed of
the trick, Father Brazil sought out the recreant
son of Erin, secured him, and marched him up
to the House chamber just as the roll was
about to be called, and sat severely by until
his charge had answered "Aye."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_367.jpg">THE CAPITOL, DES MOINES.</a><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a></div>

<p>It took twelve years to build the capitol.
During practically all of that time its construction
was under the absolute control of three
commissioners, John G. Foote, Peter A. Dey,
and Robert S. Finkbine, and the stately structure
that now adorns Capitol Hill is a monument
to their intelligence and integrity. Not
an unwise expenditure nor a dishonest or corrupt
transaction was ever charged against their
stewardship, and the people of Iowa hold their
names and services in grateful memory. It is
a sad commentary on our public morals that
the erection of a State capitol without suspicion
of corruption is so exceptional as to be
noteworthy and the proud distinction of the
people of this Western commonwealth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_369.jpg">THE IOWA HISTORICAL LIBRARY.</a><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a></div>

<p>From a frontier fort and a huddle of huts,
Des Moines has grown to be a stately city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
whose corporate limits include fifty-four square
miles and a population of nearly 70,000, almost
double the population of any other city in
Iowa. Her citizens boast that "without riots,
booms, or conflagrations" she has steadily
grown in strength and stature. Her industries
and commerce make the city a hive of activities.
Seventeen railroads radiate from Des
Moines, enabling the city to become the wholesale
and retail jobbing centre of the State.
Sixty miles of electric street-railways and fifty-eight
miles of paved streets make her suburbs
readily accessible. There are vast deposits of
coal and clay under and about the city. The
smoke of three hundred factories, large and
small, tinge her atmosphere with the hues of
Pittsburg. Among insurance men the city is
called the "Hartford of the West," as fifty-one
insurance companies have their headquarters in
Des Moines and employ five thousand people.
In her various colleges and schools of law, medicine,
and commercial practice there is a population
of nearly six thousand. Thousands of
visitors annually come to the State Agricultural
Fair and to the political and educational conventions
that assemble in the city. Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
has recently provided for the establishment of
an army post just south of the city limits, and
the War Department is about to expend several
hundred thousand dollars in erecting barracks
and in the preparation of drill-grounds
for troops.</p>

<p>Few cities in the West possess scenery of
greater natural beauty than that which greets
the eye in and about Des Moines. The junction
of the rivers near the centre of the city
gives her topography a configuration similar to
that of Pittsburg. On the south and east
her limits are marked by a range of wooded
hills through which the silver stream of the
united rivers makes its way. The view of the
landscape across the river valley to the horizon's
edge which is visible from most points is
particularly pleasing to the eye in the spring
and summer months. The main part of the
city between the "Forks" is in a forest of native
oaks, elms, and hickories so dense that the
looker from the Capitol dome can scarce perceive
the residences. To the attractions of
nature the landscape gardener and architect
have added much. Nearly five hundred acres
of parks give the people fine pleasure resorts
in the hot summer months. Many handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
wholesale and retail houses and manufacturing
establishments grace her thoroughfares. The
city has nearly completed a beautiful Public
Library, located on the west bank of the Des
Moines River, and, as a result of the years
of devotion and unremitting labors of Mr.
Charles Aldrich, the State has begun the
erection of the Historical Library, which will
be one of the chief attractions of Des Moines.</p>

<h2>ST. LOUIS<br />

"THE FUTURE GREAT"</h2>

<p class="chapby">By WILLIAM MARION REEDY</p>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">S</span>ITUATED at the heart of the continent,
midway between the East and West, the
North and South, St. Louis is a unique mixture
of the characteristics of all sections of the
United States. In the early seventies a weird
character named L.U. Reavis wrote a book
called <i>St. Louis, the Future Great City of the
West</i>, in which he advocated the removal
hither of the seat of the national Government
and predicted great things for the city.
The fourth of American cities in population,
St. Louis is preparing to hold a World's Fair
in commemoration of the one hundredth anniversary
of the purchase of the Louisiana territory,
on a scale of magnificence which attracts
universal attention. With the completion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
the Chicago drainage canal, destined soon to
be a ship canal connecting Lake Michigan with
the Mississippi River, with the necessary improvement
of the Mississippi to its mouth, and
with the certain construction of an Isthmian
canal, St. Louis is sure to be in as close touch
with the world at large as if it were a seacoast
city. Always the natural commercial centre of
the Mississippi Valley, since it became the focus
of a mighty network of railroads St. Louis has
been the market of the prosperous West, the
new South and the great Southwest, with its
wealth of agriculture, mining, manufactures,
and its almost magic development, shown, for
instance, in the fact that Texas is now only
a few thousand behind Missouri in population,
and must in consequence of the recent discoveries
of enormous oil lands soon overtake States
like Illinois and Ohio and Pennsylvania. The
prophecies of the city's greatness are coming
to realization. Its future is here, but bright
as the future is, it is not so bright as to allure
us into forgetting the picturesque past.</p>

<p>The old town on the Mississippi has ever
been modest to a degree that has caused the
thoughtless to make mock of its conservatism,
but the steadiness of character and the regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
only for the realities of progress which have
marked St. Louis have their justification in
that they have resulted in a city known in times
of depression and panic as "the solid city." A
city that owns itself, with a proper sense of
dignity, it has never advertised itself in the
modern meretricious fashion. And so the story
of St. Louis, an honest tale, will speed best
being simply told.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_376.jpg">COLONEL AUGUSTE CHOUTEAU, ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF ST. LOUIS.
FROM A PAINTING IN MISSOURI HISTORICAL SOCIETY COLLECTION.</a><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a></div>

<p>St. Louis was founded by Pierre Laclede
Liguest and a few companions, all French
<i>voyageurs</i>, in 1764; at least it was in that year
that Laclede's lieutenant, Auguste Chouteau,
cleared away the site of the present city.
Laclede Liguest, or, as he is sometimes known,
Liguest Laclede, a merchant of New Orleans,
had from the French Government a monopoly
of the fur trade in the Missouri River country.
He left New Orleans with his family and a
small party in August, 1763, with the intention
of founding a town near the confluence of the
Missouri and Mississippi rivers. Shortly after
the town was laid out occurred the cession to
Great Britain of the Illinois country, on the
east bank of the Mississippi. The French inhabitants
of that country having followed from
the north in the wake of Marquette in 1673,<span class="pagenum">[334]</span>
and of La Salle in 1678, hated the English,
and began to move over to the new town,
which soon grew into importance. A trading
point for the Indians, Laclede and his companions
so managed them that there was none
of the friction which marked the contact elsewhere
of the English and the natives. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
the laying out of the city began a band of one
hundred and fifty warriors, with their squaws
and papooses, outnumbering the whites five to
one, appeared and camped near the strangers.
The Frenchmen treated the savages with such
tact and kindness that they not only did no
harm, but even of their own volition assisted
in the work. The first cellar was excavated
with the aid of the squaws, who carried off the
clay in baskets, and were paid in beads and
other trinkets which Laclede had brought up
from New Orleans. The Indians became so
friendly that they were a hindrance rather than
a help, and finally, to induce them to depart,
Laclede hinted that the French soldiers at
Fort Chartres were to be summoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_378.jpg">THE OLD CHOUTEAU MANSION BUILT FOR LACLEDE IN 1765.
FROM DAGUERREOTYPE IN MISSOURI HISTORICAL SOCIETY COLLECTION.</a><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a></div>

<p>Shortly after the little village was begun,
news came that the territory of Louisiana had
been ceded to Spain. The French Governor,
M. d'Abadie, who announced the fact to the
people with tears, is said to have died of grief.
St. Ange de Bellerive became Commandant or
Governor-General in 1765, instituted a government,
and demeaned himself in such manner
generally that unto this day he is remembered
affectionately in every published history of the
town. The first two grants of land in the<span class="pagenum">[336]</span>
village were made to Laclede by De Bellerive,
August 11, 1766. The Spaniards do not appear
to have paid much attention to the village
of St. Louis, for there was some doubt
whether De Bellerive had any authority to
make grants. Although the best authorities
agree that De Bellerive acted with the authority
and consent of the Commandant-General
of New Orleans, it seems that he was practically
elected Governor by the inhabitants. It
is amusing to read in a history of St. Louis
and Missouri, published in 1870, that De Bellerive
in 1776, began to make grants, "hoping
for a retrocession of the country to France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
when the grants would be legalized by confirmation."
The first marriage in the new colony
was celebrated April 20, 1766, the contracting
parties being Toussaint Honen and Marie
Baugenon. The first mortgage was recorded
September, 1766. It was specified that payment
should be made in peltries, though no
definite value was attached to the number of
deer hides to be delivered by Pierre Berger to
Francis Latour.</p>

<p>August 11, 1767, news came that Spain was
making ready to take possession of the country.
The transfer had been made by secret treaty in
1762. The people accepted the situation in a
sort of dumb rage. The following year a
body of troops arrived under the command of
a man named Rios, acting under the authority
of Don Antonio d'Ulloa, Governor of Louisiana.
To the joy of the inhabitants, De Bellerive
was not disturbed in his office, and the
Spanish troops left in the summer of 1769.</p>

<p>It was the great distinction of De Bellerive
that he was the friend of Pontiac, the Ottawa
chieftain, and about the time of the departure
of the Spaniards, Pontiac arrived at St. Louis.
He represented all the poetry and nobility, the
grandeur and genius of the Indian character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
After Red Jacket, he was the greatest Indian
the New World had known. Dreaming of
driving the English into the sea he had confederated
the tribes between the Allegheny and
the Mississippi, the Ohio and the Lakes into a
league against them. He had been known
and beloved by the gallant but unfortunate
Montcalm at Quebec. He had participated
in the ambuscade in which Braddock with his
life had paid the penalty of narrow-mindedness,
and had planned the massacre of Michilimackinack,
in which more than two thousand of the
English had lost their lives. The French
"loved him for the enemies he had made," and
he was "fêted and caressed," says an early
chronicler, "by many of the principal inhabitants
of the village." St. Ange de Bellerive
entertained the warrior at the house of Madame
Chouteau, but Pontiac was now a broken
man. His dream of driving back the English
beyond the Cumberland had faded. His allies
had been seduced from his support by presents
and by firewater. He, too, had made the acquaintance
of the fiery liquor, and drink was
then such a passion with him that De Bellerive
and his friends not only endeavored to prevent
the sale thereof to him in the village, but tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
to dissuade him from crossing the river to
Cahokia in response to the invitations of certain
of his friends there. Not to be dissuaded, Pontiac
crossed the river in the uniform of a French
officer, which had been given him by Montcalm.
Wandering on the outskirts of the village
of Cahokia, he was tomahawked by a
Kaskaskia Indian, who had been given a barrel
of whiskey to do the deed by an English
trader named Williamson. His friend De Bellerive
had the chief's remains brought to St.
Louis, and they were buried somewhere in the
vicinity of the site of the present Southern Hotel,
in the corridor of which was placed, in 1901, a
handsome tablet to the unfortunate warrior's
memory. Whether Pontiac was assassinated
in accordance with official English instructions,
or met his death in consequence of a private
grudge, was long a matter of dispute, but
there is no doubt that the passionate and
sympathetic Frenchmen believed for many
long years that the chief was killed to relieve
the English of the danger of his presence
and a possible utilization of his undoubted
abilities by the Power in possession of the
west bank of the Mississippi. Pontiac's
death, however, was promptly avenged upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
the Illinois Indians by members of the tribes
with which he had been in alliance.</p>

<p>Next came Don Alexander O'Reilly to take
charge of the territory of Louisiana. He arrived
at New Orleans at the head of three thousand
men to enforce his authority. There was
need for the soldiery, for though seven years
had elapsed since the cession of the territory,
the Spaniards had never actually taken possession.
The people were still French to the core.
When they heard that Don O'Reilly was
coming they even conferred together upon the
advisability of meeting him with force and preventing
his landing. The head men of the
town counselled against this, however, and their
advice prevailed, but such was the spirit of insubordination,
so many were the execrations
heaped upon the Spaniards, so frequent were
the threats of violence against them that Don
Alexander had at once to adopt stern measures.
He promptly arrested a dozen of the
ringleaders, had five of them publicly shot, and
the others, except one who committed suicide,
sent as prisoners to Cuba. The Spanish code
was put into operation throughout the territory,
and O'Reilly's deputy, Lieutenant-Governor
Piernas, arriving in St. Louis in 1770, took possession
of St. Louis, with the help of De Bellerive,
wisely conciliating the villagers. The
village settled into peace. The church, for
which ground had been set aside even before
the founders of the town had prepared to
build their own homes, was dedicated, June
24, 1770, with solemn ceremonies. Where
that first church of flattened logs set on end
with the interstices filled with mortar stood,
there stands a church to-day, and, says Elihu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
Shepard, since that time "the worship of God
on that block has not been suspended for a
single day." All De Bellerive's acts were formally
confirmed by Piernas, and the little
settlement forgot its woes under a benign
administration, which recognized village prejudices,
and shut its eyes to the loyalty everywhere
apparent to France.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_383.jpg">OLD FRENCH POST-HOUSE. BUILT IN 1770. INHABITED UNTIL 1870.</a><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a></div>

<p>Piernas narrowly escaped assassination at
the hands of an Osage chieftain who thought
himself insulted at a meeting at the Commandant's
house. The Osage, while drinking
with other Indians, divulged his intention to
kill the Governor, whereupon a Shawnee warrior
stabbed him to the heart. The slain chief
was buried with honors in the big mound to
the north of the village, an eminence that gave
to St. Louis for many years the name of "The
Mound City."</p>

<p>For twelve years the village was orderly and
quiet. The people liked the Governor who
succeeded Piernas, but the next, Don Fernando
de Leyba,&mdash;"a drunken, avaricious, and
feeble-minded man, without a single redeeming
qualification," they did not like. He came
upon the scene in 1778, at a critical time. The
American Revolution was on. The French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
and Spaniards, hating the English, were inclined
to sympathize with the colonists, so far
as they knew or cared about things happening
so far away. Fearing an attack of English and
Indians, the villagers threw up a trench and
stockade about the town, having three gates on
the sides other than the one on the river, and
built a fort in the centre of the city at what is
now, approximately, Fourth and Walnut streets,
and supplied it with four small cannon and one
company of soldiers. The people were afraid
to till the fields outside the trench and stockade,
and the men who might have braved
attack were busy building the defences. In
the spring of 1780 fears of a famine forced
the men into the fields to plant the spring
seeds.</p>

<p>On the morning of May 26, 1780, the attack
came. It was led by Canadian-French renegades,
the main body being made up of about
one thousand Upper Mississippi Indians. The
attacking party came from the north, slew forty
of the workers, carried fifteen up the river as
prisoners, in their war canoes, while the rest
made their way back to the fortifications, amid
the booming of the cannon, which saved the
fort. Leyba, who was drunk, appeared upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
the scene, it is said, sprawling in a wheelbarrow
and muttering incoherently, after the Indians
had been repulsed. He died a month
later, covered with ignominy.</p>

<p>The succeeding Lieutenant-Governor, Francisco
Cruzat, thoroughly fortified the town,
which was never afterwards molested by the
savages. While the more extensive fortifications
were in process of construction, indeed to
the peace of 1783, the price of provisions in
St. Louis was high, and visitors from New
Orleans, Ste. Geneviève, Cahokia, Kaskaskia,
and other settlements nicknamed the place
"<i>Pain Court</i>," or "short of bread." Still, it was
a time of prosperity. The town grew, and
nothing alarming happened until, in 1785, when
the people were terrified by their first sight
of the "June rise" of the Mississippi. They
saw the great yellow stream spread out over
the American Bottoms on the east bank and
the Columbia Bottom on the west bank to the
north, until it became a vast lake reaching farther
than the eye could distinctly see. They
saw the mighty flood go raging past, black with
the trunks of mighty trees torn up by the wild
waters, the villages of Cahokia and Kaskaskia
submerged, crops ruined, cattle drowned, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
houses melting into the yellow sea. St. Louis
was flooded to what is now Main Street, and
part of the people were preparing to move farther
up the high bank that ran back from the
stream, when the waters began to recede, and
the anxiety of the town was relieved. The
people called this "<i>l'année des grands eaux</i>,"&mdash;"the
year of the great waters." There
have been many such floods since, but none
more awe-inspiring than this, seen in a setting
of virgin wilderness. The flood increased
the population of the city, however, for the
settlers in the bottoms went to town and
joined in its upbuilding. In those days,
notwithstanding all the dangers of war and
flood, St. Louis seems to have been a gay
place. Society was simple, yet retaining an
indefinable air of elegance that bore the flavor
of old France. Even if they were "short of
bread," the people were hospitable, a trait which
still persists characteristic and conspicuous.
The French element has almost wholly disappeared
in newer elements, but there yet lingers,
somehow, the atmosphere of deliberate ease
among the people, even in the pressure of modern
business. So orderly was this frontier
town that during the entire period of the<span class="pagenum">[346]</span>
French and Spanish dominations but one
murder was reported.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_388.jpg">OLD MOUND, ST. LOUIS, REMOVED IN 1869.
FROM A PHOTOGRAPH IN MISSOURI HISTORICAL SOCIETY COLLECTION.</a><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a></div>

<p>Following the annalists we learn that the
city's commerce in those early days was much
hampered by a band of pirates that infested the
river at a place called Grand Tower, midway
between the mouths of the Missouri and Ohio.
Lurking at this point, where the stream is very
swift, the pirates would dart out and attack the
boats plying between New Orleans and St.
Louis, kill the boatmen and seize the goods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
They secured rich spoil of hides from the down
trade, and many luxurious articles from the up
trade&mdash;treasures even from distant France.
One <i>voyageur</i> north bound escaped the pirates
through the strategy and courage of a negro
who won the confidence of the captors of the
barge and the sympathy of two negro slaves of
the pirates. At a signal the negroes hurled
the buccaneers off the barge, and either shot
them or left them to drown. The barge crew
then took the boat once more, went back to New
Orleans, and told their story to the Governor,
who issued an order that all boats leaving for
St. Louis should go in company. In obedience
in the spring of 1788 ten barges started up the
river with crews well armed. Arrived at the
rendezvous of the robbers they found none,
but they recovered, however, much of the
plunder that had been stored away and brought
it to St. Louis. The year of their arrival was
known for generations as "<i>l'année des dix
bateaux</i>,"&mdash;"the year of the ten boats."</p>

<p>St. Louis traded not only with New Orleans
but with Canada as well. The Indians gave no
trouble up stream or down. The Spanish Government
wanted settlers, and was liberal in
granting land. We read that "there were no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
mails or taverns, but every house was a welcome
house to new comers." In 1798 the population
of Upper Louisiana was 6028, of whom 1080
were colored. The population had risen in 1804
to 10,340. In 1803 the Louisiana Purchase was
made, and in 1804 St. Louis "contained one
hundred and eighty houses built of hewn logs
and stone, the latter being generally the rendezvous
of the most wealthy, and surrounded by a
wall of the same material, enclosing the whole
block, which continued in use many years, protecting
the fine fruit trees, which shaded the
mansion." Frame houses became fashionable
after the transfer to the United States.
"There were but one bakery, two small taverns,
three blacksmiths, two mills, and one doctor in
the town." Coffee and sugar were $2.00 per
pound, and everything else was costly in proportion.
The United States took possession
March 10, 1804, when Major Amos Stoddard
assumed the duties of Governor of Upper
Louisiana. Then history began to make
quickly.</p>

<p>Near St. Louis, Lewis and Clark organized
their expedition via the Missouri and Columbia
rivers to the Pacific Ocean, departing in May,
1804. In August Lieutenant Zebulon Pike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
started to explore the Mississippi to its source.
The Mississippi was opened up to free navigation.
General William Henry Harrison came
from Indiana to preside over the district. He
was succeeded by General James Wilkinson,
and the region formerly known as the District of
Louisiana became known as the Territory of
Louisiana. Later a strangely handsome, dark,
romantic man, much honored by every one and
indescribably fascinating in manner, visited the
town and was fêted. He was entertained by
General Wilkinson, through whom it is believed
the authorities at Washington first
learned of that vast, vague treason which
Burr&mdash;for it was he&mdash;conceived in his restless
brain. Wilkinson was later appointed to
watch Burr and was succeeded as Governor by
Captain Meriwether Lewis, fresh from his adventures
in the mysterious Northwest. A
ferry had been established in 1797, and at the
same spot there is to-day a ferry operating,
one of the most profitable of the vested interests
of St. Louis. The post-office was established
in 1804. In 1810 the population was
fourteen thousand. In 1808 was founded the
first newspaper, which exists to-day as the <i>St.
Louis Republic</i>, a daring enterprise begun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
when the whole country was suffering from the
embargo and non-intercourse with England.
The great New Madrid earthquake shook
the little city in 1811. The battle of Tippecanoe
had been fought a little before the
earthquake, and in the same year appeared
the first steamboat in Western waters. In
1813 the Territory of Louisiana became the
Territory of Missouri, and in June of that year
the Bank of St. Louis was founded. The year
before that the Governor of the Territory had
gathered in the city of St. Louis the chiefs of
the Great and Little Osages, the Sacs, Foxes,
Delawares, and Shawnees, made peace with
them, then conducted them to Washington, arriving
there just before the declaration of war
against Great Britain, in time to conclude a
peace which saved the country from any such
conspiracy as had been formed among the
Indian tribes to the east, under the leadership
of the great Tecumseh.</p>

<p>Being a frontier town, St. Louis was of
course a resort for trappers and traders but,
unlike the frontier towns of to-day, not for
desperadoes. The early settlers seem to have
stamped upon the place its distinctive quality
of quietness. Here the North American Fur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
Company had its headquarters for a long time,
and from this point the adventurous subordinates
of John Jacob Astor went forth in all
directions in search of peltries. One of these,
a Colonel Russell Farnum, leaving St. Louis
afoot reached Behring Strait in 1813-14, crossed
over the ice, traversed Siberia and, arriving at
St. Petersburg, was presented to the Emperor.
This memorable journey was the wonder of
Europe at the time, for Farnum went from St.
Petersburg to Paris and then came home by
way of New York. He wrote a record of
his adventures and sent it to a New York
publisher but it was lost and the writer
died before he could again transcribe his
narrative.</p>

<p>The War of 1812 with Great Britain for a
time was of small concern to St. Louis. Later,
however, the Indians of Missouri were armed
by the people and pitted against the Indians
employed by the British. The trading-posts
in which St. Louis was interested extended
twelve hundred miles to the north and there
agents from St. Louis counter-plotted against
the British. The Yanktons and Omahas were
matched by the Americans against the Iowas
and several battles were fought in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
British-bought savages were worsted. The
war coming to an end, Indian hostilities ceased
and the fur trade throve under the peace.
Rivals to the American Fur Company were
started. The business expanded, and soon the
necessities of commercial intercourse led to the
organization of two banks, the second of which,
known as the Bank of Missouri, was organized
February 1, 1817. Inflation was the order of
the day. The town took on airs of magnificence
and extravagance. Wealth accumulated
so rapidly that some seemed at a loss to
spend it, and gave entertainments in which the
tasteful and the barbaric were strangely mingled.
The United States held sales of public
lands and there were "rushes" such as we
have seen in recent years in Oklahoma. Building
was undertaken in a lordly fashion and
extravagant prices were asked for everything.
The demand for money was so great that recourse
was had to lotteries to raise funds for
an academy at Potosi, to provide fire-engines
for the city, to erect a Masonic Hall. The
lotteries soon got into politics and were not
dislodged until late in the seventies, after a
fight not unlike that waged for many years in
Louisiana. It was in 1817 that the Legislature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
of Missouri established the public-school system
and incorporated the institution which
persists to-day in the St. Louis Board of Education,
though it was many years before there
was a public school in the city. In the same
year, in St. Louis, Thomas H. Benton, afterwards
United States Senator from Missouri for
thirty years, leaped into notice, engaged in a
quarrel with Charles Lucas, United States
Attorney for the Territory of Missouri, and in
a duel across the river, or rather on an island
in the river that has since become joined to
the Illinois shore, killed him. The place
where the duel was fought became the rendezvous
for duellists and was called "Bloody
Island." In 1817 the first Bible Society in the
Territory of Missouri was formed. The inflation
of the day ended as usual in collapse,
but St. Louis and Missouri suffered less harm
than other sections.</p>

<p>When, in 1818, the Territory of Missouri
applied for admission to the Union the slavery
question arose. There was a slight preponderance
of sentiment in favor of slavery, but
very slight. The Missouri Compromise left
its mark on Missouri and St. Louis. The
State was always regarded, however its repre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>sentatives
stood, as doubtful on the slavery
issue. From 1820 to the breaking out of the
Civil War it was always a compromise State
and in that war it was ever between two fires,
furnishing soldiers in startling abundance to
each side and sympathizing with both. St.
Louis suffered in that long drawn out situation.
A paralyzing incertitude was bred in the
city's mind, even toward progress. The people,
especially the French, did not take kindly to
steamboats. "When Missouri was admitted
to the Union," says Elihu Shepard, "there
was no steamboat owned in the State and but
one steam mill." The assessed valuation of
the town property was less than $1,000,000
and the whole corporation tax less than $4000
per year while Missouri remained a territory.
The town contained six hundred houses, one
third of which were of stone or brick, the
remainder wooden, one half of which were
framed. The population was estimated at
five thousand, one fourth of whom were
French. The estimated annual value of the
trade was $600,000. Steamboats from the
Ohio River took the carrying trade between
St. Louis and New Orleans, and the imports
were estimated at $1,000,000. All these con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>ditions,
while due in some measure to the extreme
conservatism and self-satisfaction of the
dominant French element, were undoubtedly
due in larger measure to the hard times that
prevailed when Missouri became a State. St.
Louis was incorporated as a city December 9,
1822. A spice of adventure always entered
into the then predominant business of the
community, for the fur companies fought with
each other, and all of them made common
cause against the great Hudson Bay Company
in the North, with its headquarters in
Canada. The people of that time thought
little of distances which even now seem great.
Traders and trappers went without hesitation
through the wilderness to the very surf of
the Pacific and the people of the city never
dreamed that what we now call Yellowstone
Park was very far away. Often enough the
adventurous commercial traveller who left St.
Louis came back without his scalp or never
came at all. The city was picturesque. Men
clad in buckskin and carrying rifles in their
hands elbowed representatives of first families
attired in the fashion that came from Paris, via
New Orleans, or consorted with red Indians in
paint and feathers&mdash;and too often, too, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
liquor. St. Louis and Missouri were "big"
in politics about that time. Missouri was for
Clay, but Missouri's representative did not
vote for him and John Quincy Adams was
chosen President. After this Missouri became
a Jackson State, and committed herself
to the South.</p>

<p>A patch of color in the drab details of the
history of St. Louis for the few years after the
incorporation was the visit of Lafayette to
the city on April 29, 1825, and his sumptuous
entertainment by the enthusiastic inhabitants,
most of whom, probably, loved the Frenchman
more than the friend of Washington. In June,
1825, the first Presbyterian church was consecrated
by Rev. Solomon Giddings, who "had a
very respectable congregation" for a city which
was preponderantly French and Roman Catholic.
The French language was spoken in the
homes of half the families of the town. There
were less than a dozen German families in a
city which now is more distinctly Teutonic than
any other in the country, except Milwaukee.
The slavery issue was all the while growing,
and in 1828 there was formed at St. Louis a
branch of the American Colonization Society,
the purpose of which was to further the settle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>ment
of free blacks in Liberia. Many of the
largest slave-owners in the city and State were
members and officers of the society. Between
1820 and 1831, a progressive movement
started. The new Court House was dedicated
in 1829, and the work of opening and paving
streets was pushed with energy. The old
French families resented the new life and
moved into the country. The pace was too
fast for them. The hunters, trappers, <i>voyageurs</i>
and bargemen began to disappear.
The city took on a truly American aspect,
but the increase of population was slow.
Between 1820 and 1830, the population increased
only 2000, but between 1830 and
1840 the increase was nearly 10,000, reaching
the total of 16,649.</p>

<p>Gradually Americanism made its impress.
The wharf was lined with steamboats and the
levee with great stores. Steam ferryboats
multiplied. The city became a great river
town, second in importance only to New Orleans.
The lead mines to the south of the
city were productive. Manufactures of various
sorts sprang up. An insurance company
was incorporated. Prosperity was checked
by fear of the great Black Hawk, who, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
head of the Sac and Fox Indians, took the
war-path in Illinois. Immigration and transportation
of goods to and from the North was
checked till Black Hawk was defeated and
his tribe transported to the other side of the
river, where the influence of Great Britain
could not reach them. No sooner, however,
had the city recovered from its slight panic
than there came another and graver excitement,
another lull in business. Jackson's
bank veto was the cause. As if this were not
enough to discourage the community, along
came the cholera, which in five weeks destroyed
four per cent of the population.
Cholera has reappeared since, from time to
time, the most serious visitation being in 1866,
but the city as it grew began to pay attention
to the sewage question and in half a century
had perfected such a sewer system as is not surpassed
in any city in the world. In 1835 the
City Council sold the town Commons, a tract
of about two thousand acres, and devoted
nine tenths of the proceeds to street improvements
and one tenth to the public schools,
and from this small beginning arose the system
which to-day directs the education of the
children of a city of 575,000 inhabitants. In
1829 the St. Louis University, a Jesuit institution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
was founded, which has been since
a centre of higher education for the sons of
the well-to-do Roman Catholics of the entire
South and Southwest. Considerably later
was founded the institution now Washington
University, one of the best endowed educational
establishments in the country, with a
manual training department famous the world
over, and with its Mary Institute for girls
ranking with the best seminaries of the country.
At an early day the Roman Catholic
religious sisterhoods of charity and instruction
established branches here. The Sisters of
Charity founded a hospital in 1832, aided by
the liberality of John Mullanphy, which has
been in continuous service ever since. The
Sisters of the Visitation came later and established
their convent for the higher education
of girls and did for the girls of the West and
South what the St. Louis University did for
the boys. Still later came the establishment
of medical colleges, one in connection with
the St. Louis University, and later the institutions
founded by McDowell and Popé, from
which grew the swarm of large medical and
surgical colleges which now make St. Louis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
one of the most important centres of medical
education in the land.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_401.jpg">WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY AS PROJECTED, NOW UNDER CONSTRUCTION.</a><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a></div>

<p>Events moved rapidly after 1835. The
growth of river traffic was steady. The drift
of emigration westward was beneficial to St.
Louis in every way. Men and money flowed
in from the East and the South. There were
rumors of railroads, and, in April, 1835, a convention
was held by representatives of eleven
of the most populous counties of the State to
take steps to induce the construction of railroads
in the State and to and from the city.
The modern spirit manifested itself in every
direction, and the year 1836 found the people
regarding St. Louis as a metropolis, though in
that year occurred an incident demonstrating
that the taint of barbarism lingered to some
extent among the people. A negro who had
stabbed a constable was seized by a mob and
tied to a tree and burned to death, amid a
chorus of execrations,&mdash;an episode only too
frequently duplicated in different sections of the
country of late years. At this time St. Louis
had 15,000 inhabitants, but it was not till the
year following that a theatre was known. In
the same year a brick fire-engine house was
built, and leading citizens were proud to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
members of the company and "run with the
machine."</p>

<p>St. Louis was much interested in the Texan
war of independence, and from its stores supplies
went to the followers of Houston, while
many of the younger men of the community
left to join the Lone Star warriors in their struggle.
Later, when the war with Mexico began,
there were multiplied activities in the city,
because the Government here outfitted many
of its troops. Here next were heard the first
mutterings of the storm that broke in 1861.
Elijah P. Lovejoy, anti-slavery in sentiment,
edited the <i>St. Louis Observer</i>. On the night
of July 21, 1836, persons unknown broke into
the publishing room and wrecked the establishment,
scattering the type into the street. No
one was punished for the offence. Lovejoy
went to Alton, where later he was slain by fanatical
opponents of his abolitionism, who unwittingly
wrote his name high on the list of
the martyrs to freedom. St. Louis had its first
daily mail September 20, 1836, and on the
same day the <i>Missouri Republican</i> commenced
the publication of a regular daily edition. In
1837 Daniel Webster was banqueted, and it
was estimated that there were more guests at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
the banquet than there were inhabitants of the
city when Lafayette was fêted twelve years
before.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_407.jpg">ST. LOUIS IN 1854. FROM A PRINT IN MISSOURI HISTORICAL SOCIETY COLLECTION.</a><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a></div>

<p>Following in quick succession, events too
numerous to be recapitulated marked the history
of the town. In spite of floods and cholera
and a great fire, which swept away the
business portion of the city, the community
went steadily ahead. The gold-fever helped
St. Louis, for the Argonauts going overland
outfitted here, as in very recent years their
fellows bound for the Klondike and Cape Nome
outfitted at Seattle. As the West built up St.
Louis builded too. Something substantial from
the westward-moving stream always found its
way into the coffers of the St. Louis merchants.
The prosperity and power of the South lent
prestige to the city. The city was a great cotton
market. It had a vast trade up and down
the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, up and
down the Ohio and the Tennessee. The fleets
of steamboats at the wharves grew in size, until,
old inhabitants say, there were three or four
miles of them at the river front at one time,
being loaded and unloaded day and night by
singing negroes. As agriculture grew in importance,
St. Louis became a great wheat market,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
a great market for cattle and swine, horses and
mules. Its manufactures in every line throve,
as well they might, for it was the great depot
of the West, with a straightaway water route to
the sea. There was plenty of work, plenty
of money, and more than plenty of pleasure.
The society of St. Louis was exclusive and
magnificent. The ante-bellum balls were gorgeous
affairs. The women were beautiful, of
the Southern type, and when it was desired to
say of one of them that she was royally bejewelled,
a common phrase used was "She wore
a nigger on every finger." Steamboatmen,
planters, slave-traders, merchants dealing in
cotton or in sugar, spent money like water.
The town was, as we say in these days, wide
open, and of a perilous liveliness, for the incoming
Northerners and Easterners were never
equal to the task of suppressing what the New
England American regards as vices not to be
temporized with. The brightness and gayety,
however, did not wholly conceal the dread of
the sorrow that was to come. St. Louis was,
for the most part, intensely Southern; but the
Revolution of 1848 had brought to this country
and to St. Louis a great number of Germans,
who were set against slavery and secession.
The storm broke, and the breaking was a severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
setback to St. Louis, whose prosperity was
founded chiefly on that of the South. Its
sympathies, through social, political, business
ties, were mainly with the South. The
war destroyed business. St. Louis, if not the
enemy's country, was strongly suspected of disloyalty,
and for a time it seemed as if war would
smite the city itself, while there hung in the
balance the decision of the alternative of Governor
Claiborne Jackson of Missouri that he
would "take Missouri out of the Union or into
hell." Feeling ran high in the community.
Almost a battle was fought on its outskirts.
St. Louis had bitter experiences of martial law,
while its commercial activities seemed to be
mostly controlled by people who had government
contracts. Here, where Grant had been
known as a none too tidy farmer, his name was
loathed, as was Lincoln's, by the larger element,
while the Germans were profoundly loyal.
The misfortunes of the South were unfortunate
for St. Louis in every instance, and when the
scourge of war passed, the region whence
St. Louis had drawn most of its wealth was
devastated, and the sceptre of trade passed
to the North. As the fortunes of St. Louis</p>

<p class="noin">declined from these causes, they and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
causes operated to push Chicago to the front,
even though, when Chicago had been twice
visited by fire, St. Louis, as the greater city,
made large contributions to the relief of the
sufferers. St. Louis did not go backward, but
the country to the north recovered from the
war and improved more rapidly than that to
the south and southwest, and the northern and
western trade went to Chicago. St. Louis
managed, in the face of such obstacles, to hold
its own. The work of expansion and extension
of improvement went steadily ahead,
though with great conservatism. The
boom idea, that grew after the war, was
never hospitably entertained in St. Louis,
though the manufacturers and merchants found
a new trade and strenuously developed it in
the new Southwest. The southwestern railway
systems began to take shape, and the prosperity
of St. Louis came back in great measure
late in the eighties. The great St. Louis
bridge had been opened in 1874, and the city
was put in touch with the East, but the greater
movement of the country's wealth and energy
was being felt in the territory that was out of
trade touch and political sympathy with the</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_411.jpg">FOREST PARK, ST. LOUIS.</a><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a></div>

<p class="noin">field in which St. Louis was once supreme.
Nevertheless St. Louis added to her beauties
steadily. She acquired Forest Park, the greatest
natural public city park in the country,
after Fairmount in Philadelphia, also O'Fallon
Park, but little less magnificent. Through the
philanthropic generosity of Henry Shaw she
acquired Tower Grove Park, which is perhaps
the finest specimen of the park artificial
to be found anywhere. Later, Mr. Shaw left
to the city by will his botanical garden, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
institution famous the world over for its collection
of plants of almost every species. The
city paved all its downtown streets with granite,
and later its outlying streets with asphalt,
erected a new custom house, a Four Courts
Building, stupendous water-works, and constructed
a gigantic extension of the sewer system.
The development of the system of street railway
transportation in St. Louis was more
rapid and more perfect than in any other city
in the world. A new mercantile library was
built and the public-school library was made
free. Churches increased in great numbers.
Schools multiplied and were overcrowded in
places where within twenty years had been
quarry ponds and cow pastures. The growth
of business, the multiplication of banks, the
overspreading of the population since 1880,
has been bewildering in its progress, and remains
so, in spite of the fact that there has been
all this time in process of building, directly
across the river, a sort of overflow city of sixty
thousand people. The city lost its river trade
but has made up for it in utilization of the railroads,
and is now preparing again to use the
mighty, free, natural highway for the transportation
of products to the world at large. St.
Louis, so often thought of as slow, has really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
grown with phenomenal rapidity. It is one of
the wealthiest cities in the country, a city of
homes, and a city of perhaps more beautiful
homes widely distributed in different sections
than are to be found elsewhere. The wealthy
men of St. Louis are almost all young men.
The greater fortunes in St. Louis, with but few
exceptions, have been made within the past
twenty years, and many of them in the last ten
years, and these now utterly eclipse the fortunes
that have been handed down from the
earlier days. The city has to-day a population
of 575,000. In the suburban territory there
are over 700,000 more people in close relationship
daily and almost hourly with the business
and social life of the city. The "slow old
town" is not so slow when it is remembered that
within one year after a cyclone swept it in May,
1896, there was not a trace of the visitation.
Its conservatism is very real, but it is not
stagnation. St. Louis has gone on with its
work, even though war and the industrial tendencies
consequent on war, and the political
and social drift growing out of war have been
in opposition to the city's progress. The city
has built steadily but well, passing through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
panic of 1893 without a single failure. The
earlier history of the town shows how the conservatism
so thoughtlessly derided came to be
ingrained in the life of the city. It shows, too,
the pertinacity which has made St. Louis the
fourth city in the Union, in defiance of the
disaster that befell its prestige in the great
war, and in defiance too of the circumstance
that the new popular national activities generated
after that great conflict found their most
congenial field in regions practically out of
reach of, and wholly antipathetic to the interests
of the chief city of Missouri. The new
South and the new Southwest mean a new St.
Louis. And we shall see what the new St.
Louis means when the city expresses its higher
and better self in the Exposition with which its
people purpose to celebrate the purchase, by
the United States, in 1803, of the Louisiana<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>

<h2>KANSAS CITY<br />

THE CENTRAL CITY</h2>

<p class="chapby">By CHARLES S. GLEED</p>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">I</span>N early literature and in early United States
Indian treaties the Indian word "Kansas"
appears as Caucis, Konza, Konseas, Kons,
Kanzaw, Kanzau, Kaw, and Kanzas. Kansas,
meaning smoky, was the name of a tribe of
Indians still existing in the Indian Territory
and it came to be applied to all the country
west of the Missouri River over which the
tribe roamed (the country which is now largely
in the State of Kansas), and also to its chief
river.</p>

<p>There are two Kansas Cities, one in <ins class="corr" title='Correction: Text was "Misouri"'>Missouri</ins>,
the other in Kansas. The Kansas City
in Missouri was named after the Kansas Indians,
the Kansas River, the Kansas country, or
all of them. The Kansas City in Kansas was
named after the Kansas City in Missouri. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
two cities are one except in law and the line
dividing them is not discoverable except by
the surveyor. The Kansas City in Kansas
was made up of a number of small towns the
chief of which was Wyandotte. It was thought
that the Kansas town would be helped by
adopting the good name belonging to the Missouri
town. The Kansas City in Kansas has
about 60,000 people; the Kansas City in Missouri
has about 225,000. The former is the
largest city in Kansas, while the latter is
the second city in Missouri. In this sketch
the two towns are considered as one.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_419.jpg"> KANSAS CITY FROM THE SOUTH.</a><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a></div>

<p>Among large cities Kansas City is central,
for the exact centre of the United States is
about two hundred miles west in Kansas. At
the point where Kansas City is located, the
Kansas or "Kaw" River coming from the
west empties into the Missouri River coming
from the North. The Kansas-Missouri
State line runs south from near the junction
of the two rivers. In the angles formed by
this junction are very high hills, almost mountains.
Standing on the high point close in the
southern angle, one may look away for ten to
twenty miles to the north and the east along
the valley of the Missouri and to the west
along the valley of the Kansas. It is in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
valleys and on these miniature mountains
that the city is built. The parts in the valleys
present no special difficulties to the town
builder, but in the higher parts almost every
difficulty is presented. The hills are composed
of rocks which must be blasted, and of yellow
clay. The original bluffs are cut by numerous
ravines leading towards the rivers, and those
streets running parallel with the rivers and
therefore crossing the ravines are necessarily in
many cases very steep. This topographical situation
has required the removal of enormous
quantities of earth and rock, the filling of great
ravines, and the artificial establishment of the
grades of streets. This rendered the city unsightly
through its earlier years, but the unsightliness
is rapidly giving way to great
beauty and picturesqueness.</p>

<p>The first plat of the "Town of Kansas" was
filed in 1839. It included the land bordering
the Missouri River some distance south and
east of the mouth of the Kansas River and
bounded by the river, the present Second
Street, the present Delaware Street, and the
present Grand Avenue. There was no technical
incorporation, and the common name of the
place was at first Westport Landing&mdash;this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
being the river landing for the trading post
called Westport, four or five miles south of the
river.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_421.jpg"> JACKSON COUNTY COURT HOUSE, KANSAS CITY.</a><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a></div>

<p>In 1850, the County Court of Jackson
County, Missouri, at Independence, created the
"Town of Kansas" as an incorporation governed
by a Board of Trustees. The first
board, appointed February 4, 1850, failed to
act and on June 3d of the same year another
board was appointed, composed of William
Gillis, Madison Walrond, Lewis Ford, Bennoist
Troost, and Henry W. Brice. This
board controlled the town until the Legislature
of Missouri, February 22, 1853, granted
the right of incorporation to the city of Kansas.
From the small original town, by one addition
after another, has grown a city covering an
area of nearly one hundred square miles.</p>

<p>Long before any incorporation or any platting
of town sites there was much activity in
this locality. Judge E.P. West, an eminent
local geologist, produces indisputable evidence
in the shape of stone arrow-heads and
spear-heads found on the present town site
that the place was inhabited at least 21,000
years ago. The local museum contains a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
number of specimens of flint and stone work
indicating to geologists and archæologists the
presence of races dating back many centuries.</p>

<p>In 1825, the Jesuit Fathers penetrated all
parts of the wilderness surrounding what is
now Kansas City. They were doubtless the
first white settlers and in all probability they
had only the usual purpose, zeal in propagating
the religion of their fathers. They are
known to have built a small log house in the
neighborhood of the northern part of what is
now Troost Avenue. It was as much a church
as a dwelling, for here the tribes to whom
they had come attended religious service. In
1835 a missionary named Father Roux established
the first actual church in this locality.
There were many trappers and hunters of the
French-Canadian type who had intermarried
with the Indians. In 1835 Father Roux purchased
of a Canadian some forty acres on the
hill adjoining the present site of the Roman
Catholic Cathedral, almost exactly in the centre
of the present city, and in 1839 was instrumental
in having a log church built on a part
of the land situated between what are now
Eleventh and Twelfth Streets on Penn Street.
Here for a period of at least twenty years a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
congregation composed largely of French
Canadians and the children of the French and
Indian intermarriages worshipped together.
In 1845 Father Bernard Donnelly was made
pastor of all Western Missouri, and ministered
to the Indians and whites alike. Through his
efforts a brick church was erected on the corner
of what are now Eleventh Street and
Broadway, and from 1857 to 1880, when he
retired from active work to die a few months
later at the age of eighty, he devoted himself
entirely to his priestly duties. The church
and the city owe an unmeasured debt of
gratitude to this unselfish and lovable man.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_425.jpg"> CONVENTION HALL, KANSAS CITY.</a><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a></div>

<p>Questions of transportation have been of
overwhelming interest to the people of Kansas
City from the beginning. The first crossing
of the Missouri River at this point was
established in 1836 by the operation of a flatboat
at the mouth of the "Kaw." The Rev.
Isaac McCoy and his son established the ferry
and operated it until 1854. Then came the
horse-power ferryboat, and the steam ferryboat.
In due time full-fledged steamboats made their
appearance on the Missouri. Westport Landing,
by reason of a rocky bank and deep
water in front of it, afforded an excellent
landing. Here were unloaded the goods for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
the great Indian and Mexican trade of the
West, and from here were shipped eastward
wool, furs, buffalo robes, and other products
of the region. Immigration overland to Colorado,
Utah, Nevada, Mexico, and California
came to this point in boats and then went
westward by the old Santa Fé trail. From
about 1850 to the coming of the railroads,
from six to ten boats daily came to this landing.
In 1857, during the nine months of
navigation, no fewer than fifteen hundred
boats arrived and departed. Some of them
were palatial structures, judged even by the
standard of to-day, and many of them were
magnificently furnished and equipped to care
for passengers.</p>

<p>One of the early features of the travel and
traffic between Kansas City and the West
was the old Concord Coach and another was
the ox and mule wagon known as the "Prairie
Schooner." The coaches carried from ten
to fifteen passengers, and the passengers as a
rule carried from two to a dozen weapons of
defence against the Indians. At one time
the fare per passenger from Westport to
Santa Fé, New Mexico, was $175 in gold, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
the schedule time was thirteen days and six
hours. The trip involved travelling night
and day, asleep and awake, without stopping
except for meals. The "Overland Mail Express
Company" maintained an office for
years on the Levee, and for carrying mails
received $172,000 a year. Mail, passengers,
and express matter usually yielded from $5000
to $6000 a trip.</p>

<p>In 1843, the Mexican trade from this point
was suspended by Santa Anna, who closed the
northern port of entry. As soon, however, as
the embargo was removed, trade revived and
greatly increased. At this time Atchison,
Leavenworth, St. Joseph, and Omaha entered
upon the same business, but until the Civil
War commenced Kansas City retained most of
the trade. A book published in 1843 shows the
tonnage between Kansas City and Mexico to
have increased from 15,000 tons in 1822, to
150,000 tons in 1837, the increase being fairly
uniform over the entire period. In 1850, 600
wagons began the overland trip from Kansas
City; by 1855 the trade had grown to a total
valuation of at least $5,000,000, and by 1860
had still further increased to a point which attracted
national attention. In that year a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
correspondent sent by the <i>New York Herald</i>
to study the statistics of the business, reported
that there were shipped from Kansas City in
that year 16,439,134 pounds of freight, employing
7084 men, 6147 mules, 27,920 yoke of
oxen and 3033 wagons, to which should be
added the statistics of the trade with the towns
of Kansas and Nebraska. This, for that time,
enormous bulk of business, passed over the
Santa Fé trail which is now almost exactly the
route of the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fé
Railroad.</p>

<p>At the close of the Civil War in 1865, during
which Kansas City, in common with all the
border towns of Missouri and Kansas, was disturbed
by the conflict, a tremendous immigration
began to flow westward through the city.
Railroad enterprises in Kansas and beyond
were opening up the country for settlement,
and the families of those who had lately been
engaged in war rushed westward to take up the
vacant lands offered them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_429.jpg"> THE CITY HALL, KANSAS CITY.</a><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a></div>

<p>The first railroads entering the city were
the Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph (which is now a
part of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy
system) and the Missouri Pacific&mdash;the first
entering from the direction of Chicago, and
the last from the direction of St. Louis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
The first built to the west was the Union Pacific
Railway, Eastern Division, afterwards
known as the Kansas Pacific, now a part of
the Union Pacific.</p>

<p>Railroad building in the country immediately
tributary to Kansas City became active at the
close of the Civil War, and has continued until
the present time (1901), when two new
main lines are under construction towards the
city. The railway companies with lines entering
Kansas City now are the Chicago,
Burlington &amp; Quincy, the Chicago, Rock
Island &amp; Pacific, the Atchison, Topeka &amp;
Santa Fé, the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul,
the Wabash, the Chicago &amp; Alton, the Missouri
Pacific, the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas,
the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco, the St. Joseph
&amp; Grand Island, the Kansas City, Fort Scott
&amp; Memphis, the Kansas City Southern, the
Chicago &amp; Great Western, the Kansas City
&amp; Northern, the Union Pacific, the Suburban
Belt, and the Kansas City Belt.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the United States can be seen
a better demonstration of the wonderful development
of the transportation system of the
country. Besides its trunk-line railroads the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
city has two belt railway systems and numerous
private tracks, so that its equipment for industrial
work is unexcelled. Its street-railway
system of nearly two hundred miles is one of
the finest in America. The tracks and the
equipment are thoroughly modern in every
respect.</p>

<p>The first newspaper published in Kansas
City was a weekly called the <i>Kansas Ledger</i>.
It was established in 1851, but was sold in about
fifteen months, and then sold again and removed
to Independence. The city after the
death of the <i>Ledger</i> was for eighteen months
without a newspaper office. In September,
1854, the <i>Kansas City Enterprise</i> made its appearance,
edited by W.A. Strong, D.K.
Abeel having charge of the publishing department.
In August, 1855, the <i>Enterprise</i> was
bought out by R.T. Van Horn, who assumed
editorial control in October. In January,
1857, Mr. Abeel purchased a half-interest in
the paper and in the following October the <i>Enterprise</i>
became the <i>Western Journal of Commerce</i>,
a larger and greatly improved sheet.
The <i>Kansas City Journal</i> grew out of this and
at once began to assume the high position
among the great dailies of the country which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
it has since maintained. Theodore Case, in
his history of Kansas City, a volume of some
seven hundred pages, says of the <i>Journal</i> in
1888 what may well be repeated to-day:</p>

<blockquote><p>"There is one feature that has always characterized
this paper, a never-failing devotion to home and local
interests, and an unyielding faith in the destiny of the city,
that has made it, more than any other interest, the builder
and architect of the present City of Kansas. It has furnished
more information, historical, statistical and commercial
in regard to Western Missouri, the great western
plains and the mountains, their trade, resources and
capabilities, than any other paper in the Mississippi
Valley, and when the history of the New West comes to
be written, it is to its columns that the historian will turn
for its earliest facts and figures."</p></blockquote>

<p>Colonel R.T. Van Horn continued to be
the chief owner and editor of the <i>Journal</i> until
1896, besides attending to his duties as Congressman
and in other important relations. As
the "Grand Old Man" of Kansas City, he is
to-day quietly enjoying the fruits of his long
and honorable labors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_433.jpg"> THE POST-OFFICE, KANSAS CITY.</a><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a></div>

<p>The only other Kansas City newspaper besides
the <i>Journal</i> in existence at the close of
the war was the <i>Daily Kansas City Post</i> (German)
started in the latter part of 1858, with
August Wuerz, Sr., as its first editor. Mr.
Wuerz was a strong abolitionist and so aroused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
the antipathy of the pro-slavery element that he
was forced to abandon the city in 1860. He
crossed over to Wyandotte (now Kansas City,
Kansas), published the <i>Post</i> there for nine
months, and then returned to Kansas City.
The first democratic daily established here
after the war was the <i>Advertiser</i>, which appeared
in 1865. It was succeeded in 1868 by
the <i>Kansas City Times</i>, which was issued by
the proprietors, Messrs. R.B. Drury &amp; Co.
Varying fortune marked the paper until 1878,
when, under the management of Messrs.
Munford, Munford &amp; Hasbrook, it attained a
high standing among the dailies of the country.
Of the papers which at about this time shared
the honor of representing Kansas City should
be named the <i>Kansas City News</i>, an evening
paper, which suspended after a four years' existence;
the <i>Evening Mail</i>, an evening democratic
paper, which came into existence in 1875
and which, after frequently changing its proprietors,
became, in 1882, the property of the
owner of the <i>Kansas City Star</i>, Mr. W.R. Nelson.
The <i>Kansas City Star</i> achieved remarkable
success in the hands of Mr. Nelson, and
now occupies a leading place among the dailies
of the city and the country, giving as it always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
has its best efforts towards the upbuilding and
expansion of the city. Another evening paper
which has shown evidence of the growth of the
city by its own substantial growth, is the <i>Evening
World</i>, which, established in 1894, continues
to rank well among the papers of the city.
Vicious newspapers have never been permitted
to flourish in Kansas City.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_435.jpg"> A BIT OF GLADSTONE BOULEVARD, KANSAS CITY.</a><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393"></a></div>

<p>What may be called the real-estate history
of Kansas City is peculiarly interesting. In
the year 1830 James H. McGee built a log
cabin for a residence near what is now the
corner of Twentieth and Central Streets.
He made the first kiln of brick west of Independence,
built the first brick residence in
Kansas City, and furnished the bricks for
Father Donnelly's chapel chimney. Mr. McGee
acquired by purchase nearly all the land
between the towns of Kansas City and Westport,
and his name and that of his family is
to-day so associated with the record of the
city's development that it cannot be lost.
The first working town company was formed

names subsequently were conspicuous in the
city's history. They were H.M. Northrup,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
Jacob Ragan, Henry Jobe, William Gillis, Robert
Campbell, Fry P. McGee, W.B. Evans,
W.M. Chick, and J.C. McCoy. It is said
that about 150 lots were then sold at an average
price of $55.65 per lot. This was the
nucleus of the old town and the beginning of
its most picturesque history as a real-estate
market. In the years between 1878 and 1888
(the "boom" period) the city grew extraordinarily,
the excitement over real-estate transactions
reaching a point probably unprecedented
in this country. An enormous acreage of
what never can be anything but farm land
was platted and sold as city property, and
prices for all classes of real estate reached
figures which will probably never be reached
again, at least until the city has a population
greater than now seems possible.</p>

<p>At the close of the war in 1865, Kansas
City had three banks, one insurance company,
one daily and two weekly English newspapers,
one German weekly and one bi-monthly medical
journal. The churches were two Methodist,
one Baptist, two Presbyterian, one Roman
Catholic and one Christian. There were two
lodges of Masons, two of Odd Fellows, one of
Good Templars, a Turn Verein, a Shamrock<span class="pagenum">[396]</span>
Benevolent Society, a girl's school, a rectory
school, and a German school. The census of
1860 showed a population of 4418. Now the
city stands first among the cities of the land
in the agricultural implement trade, first in
the Southern lumber trade, second in the live-stock
trade, first in the horse and mule trade,
second as a railroad centre, second in the
meat-packing business, tenth in bank clearings,
nineteenth in the value of its manufactures.
It has 50 public-school buildings,
626 teachers and 34,142 pupils. It has the
second largest park system in the country,
having over 2000 acres. It handled in 1900
$130,824,270 worth of live-stock; 32,625,850
bushels of wheat; 7,290,000 bushels of corn;
3,035,600 bushels of oats; 156,000 bushels of
rye, and 12,000 bushels of barley. It did a
wholesale business of $265,000,000, its packing
houses turned out $100,000,000 worth of
products, slaughtering 1,000,000 cattle, 2,900,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>000
hogs and 650,673 sheep. Its bank clearings
were $698,755,530. Its banking and trust company
capital was $8,000,000; it had two
hundred miles of paved streets, twenty-seven
grain elevators with a storage capacity of
6,484,000 bushels.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_439.jpg"> THE PUBLIC LIBRARY, KANSAS CITY.</a><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></div>

<p>On the non-material side the city has made a
progress even more remarkable. It is not devoted
entirely to money-getting. The humanities
have been remembered. There are some
thirty-four hospitals, asylums, and benevolent
homes. It has eight hospitals proper for the
reception of the sick, disabled, and diseased, the
Missouri Pacific Railroad Company maintaining
one. There are five children's homes, and
one industrial home. There are three homes
for the aged, one of which is for colored people
entirely. There is one convent and an institution
each for the Sisters of Charity and
the Sisters of Mercy, besides others of lesser
importance. In some cases the buildings may
not be pretentious, but they are all ample in size,
and in many instances would not discredit the
cities of the largest population. The exceptional
intelligence of the people is proved by
other unmistakable signs. Strong, clean newspapers,
beautiful opera houses, first-class hotels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
hundreds of churches, modern schools, great
libraries, charming clubs, beautiful parks and
streets, fine hospitals, fine public buildings, admirable
public utilities, and above all an enormous
proportion of beautiful homes,&mdash;these
are some of the signs that tell of the fruition
of the highest hopes of the hardy pioneers
who first gave battle to savagery and the
wilderness at this point.</p>

<p>That the city has a much greater growth before
it is the opinion of all who are familiar with
the conditions there. The vast agricultural,
mineral, and manufacturing region surrounding
it and directly tributary to it for a thousand
miles in every direction is sure to push it
steadily forward among American cities until
it ranks at last with Boston, Baltimore, and
St. Louis.</p>

THE TRANSCONTINENTAL GATEWAY</h2>

<p class="chapby">By VICTOR ROSEWATER</p>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">N</span>OW a city of 100,000 population, with
prosperous suburbs that make it the business
centre for 175,000 people, Omaha is the
outgrowth of the Nebraska &amp; Council Bluffs
Ferry Company. This company was organized
under the incorporation laws of Iowa, in
1853, to carry on the lucrative ferriage traffic
for transcontinental pilgrims in quest of the
gold-fields of California that had been begun
two years previously by a halted gold-seeker,
Brown by name, who saw more gold in paddling
passengers across the murky Missouri
than in washing the yellow sands near Sutter's
mill.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illo_444.jpg" width="200" alt="" title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">ALFRED D. JONES.</span>
</div>

<p>As an adjunct to the ferry, the company
staked out a claim adjacent to its west landing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
directly opposite Council Bluffs, and employed
Alfred D. Jones, a young civil engineer, to lay
out a town site which on pretentious paper was
invested, without particular thought or design,
with the name Omaha, from the tribe of Indians
that was wont to camp upon the creek
brushing its
north boundary.
The survey was
conducted in
June and July
of 1854, and the
adoption of the
name was doubtless
suggested
by the fact that
a month or more
before the representative
in Congress
for the
State of Iowa
had prevailed
upon the Post-Office Department to issue a
commission to Mr. Jones as postmaster at
Omaha City, which at that time must have
existed solely in his prolific imagination. Postmaster
Jones carrying the post-office around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
with him in his hat is a reminiscence founded
on actual fact and not in fancy.</p>

<p>That the ideas of these early pioneers were
of the expansible variety is readily gathered
from the character of the plat prepared to mark
the coming town site as the seat of a great and
mighty city. On the broad plateau overlooking
the river, building lots were staked out 66 by
132 feet, divided by streets 100 feet wide and
alleys of 20 feet. There were 320 blocks in
all, each comprising eight lots forming squares
of 264 feet. Two squares were reserved, one in
the business centre 264 by 280 feet, and the
other on the top of the most conspicuous hill
600 feet square, the latter designated as Capitol
Square and the hill as Capitol Hill, and a broad
avenue 120 feet wide leading to it as Capitol
Avenue&mdash;all in foreordained honor of the magnificent
structure to be erected when the newly
born city should have achieved the distinction
of the capital of Nebraska Territory. Omaha
City was not organized as an incorporated
municipality until 1857.</p>

<p>Looking closer into the history and geography
of the spot where now run the busy
streets of Nebraska's metropolis, lined with
substantial business blocks and attractive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
residences, precisely as platted in that lonely
summer of 1854, the conclusion is forced that it
was not mere fortuitous chance that built a
wonder city upon an empty ferry landing. The
location was by
nature destined
to be a turning point
on the
great central
transcontinental
highway
bridging the
divide between
the Atlantic
and the Pacific.</p>

<p>Lewis and
Clark, who
worked their
way to Oregon
up the Missouri
Valley, were the
first white men to leave a record of their visit.
From their journal is taken the following extract
noting their arrival and detention at the
mouth of the Platte in July, 1804, whence they
continued northward and passed over the
ground now included in the city:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"July 27.&mdash;Having completed the object of our stay,
we set sail with a pleasant breeze for the northwest. The
two horses swam over to the southern [western] shore,
along which we went, passing by an island, at three and
a half miles, formed by a pond, fed by springs; three
miles further is a large sand island in the middle of the
river, the land on the south [west] being high and covered
with timber; that on the north [east] a prairie. At
ten and a half miles from our encampment, we saw and
examined a curious collection of graves or mounds, on
the south [west] side of the river. Not far from a low
piece of land and a pond, is a tract of about two hundred
acres in extent, which is covered with mounds of
different heights, shapes and sizes; some of sand, and
some of both earth and sand; the largest being near the
river. These mounds indicate the position of the ancient
village of the Ottoes, before they retired to the protection
of the Pawnees. After making fifteen miles, we
camped on the south [east] on the bank of a high, handsome
prairie, with lofty cottonwood in groves, near the
river."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>That the mounds referred to constituted
the ancient Indian burial ground, remnants of
which long remained in the lower part of the
town as objects of curiosity to inquisitive observers,
has been established to the satisfaction of
historical critics, as also that the council held
by Lewis and Clark with the Indians, from</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>
<p>which Council Bluffs derives its name, took
place in reality not on the Iowa side opposite
Omaha but on the Nebraska side several miles
farther up, in the vicinity of what is now Fort
Calhoun.</p>

<p>A no less interesting historical chapter is
found in the Mormon encampment that for
a time promised to make Omaha the centre of
its church establishment. It is needless here
to state details of the Nauvoo persecutions
and the early expeditions in search of the
promised land. When the advance-guard
sighted the east bank of the Missouri, it took
a stand on Miller's hill,&mdash;so named after a Mormon
elder,&mdash;where the various companies into
which the emigrants had been divided for
their historic march across Iowa converged.
It might have been called Miller's hill to this
day had not just at that moment a call arrived
to enlist a body of volunteers for the United
States in its impending war with Mexico, followed
by the prompt organization of the Mormon
battalion under Colonel T.L. Kane, in
whose honor the name of the halting place
was changed to Kanesville. Kanesville it
might have remained but for the fact that the
post-office at that point had been designated</p>

<p class="noin">as Council Bluffs City, whither the last mail
for the emigrants setting out over the great
divide was regularly addressed; and to avoid
confusion the name of Kanesville was dropped
after two or three years and Council Bluffs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
left in undisputed possession of that corner of
the map.</p>

<p>But the east bank of the river was not suitable
for the Mormons' purposes. They crossed
over and established themselves in Winter
Quarters at a point about six miles north of
what later became Omaha, making themselves
as comfortable as possible in seven hundred
and more hastily built log cabins and dug-outs.
The place was fortified with stockades, a tabernacle
erected, and various workshops and
mills were constructed to provide temporary
employment. At Winter Quarters was held
the annual conference of the church, April 6,
1847, attended by people from all parts of the
country prepared for moving west. From
Winter Quarters, on the 14th day of the same
month, a party of about 150, all but four
or five being men, set out, with seventy-three
wagons drawn by horses and oxen, under the
personal leadership of Brigham Young, the
expedition culminating in the famous founding
of Zion in the valley of the Great Salt
Lake. The excursion of apostles and pioneers
returned to the Missouri for their families
and friends, their arrival at Winter Quarters in
October calling forth as an occasion for special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
joy and thanksgiving an elaborate celebration.
The summer of 1848 saw the great body of
Latter Day Saints following Brigham Young
to the new Utah settlement, but Winter
Quarters was maintained for years as the
stopping point and outfitting station for the
Mormon emigrants on their westward wandering.
By 1856 the name had been changed to
Florence and it is so referred to in the writings
of the later Mormons. For years it remained
the busy hiving place for the church converts
moving on Zion from all quarters of the world.
To-day it is a quaint, old-fashioned sleepy village,
interesting chiefly for a few ancient landmarks,
and visited on good-weather Sundays
by recreation seekers from Omaha in cart or
on wheel.</p>

<p>The earliest history of Omaha is a chronicle
of bitterly waged fights for the possession of
the seat of government of the new Nebraska
Territory. The proud privilege of advertising
itself as the capital city was eagerly sought after
not only by Omaha but by every other ambitious
town-site company along the eastern frontier.
It should be remembered that the initial
steps in the territorial organization were taken
under the presidency of Franklin Pierce, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
although a Northern man, was almost completely
under Southern domination. The position
of governor was first offered to General
William G. Butler of Kentucky, but unceremoniously
declined, whereupon it was passed
on to another Southern gentleman in the person
of Francis H. Burt of South Carolina.
Governor Burt arrived at Bellevue in company
with the secretary, Thomas B. Cuming of
Iowa, in October, 1854, but before he undertook
in any way to exercise his official powers
he succumbed to a fatal illness, leaving the
succession by virtue of his office to Secretary
Cuming. Governor Cuming in due time issued
his election proclamation and called the
territorial Legislature to convene at Omaha in
January. In this connection it should also be
remembered that Omaha was located and settled
by Iowa promoters while the competing
towns to the south looked on slave-holding
Missouri as the parent. Had the first capital
designation been asserted by the South Carolina
executive instead of by his fortuitous Iowa
successor we may well doubt whether Omaha
would have fared so fortunately.</p>

<p>The earliest territorial legislatures have
been described by eye-witnesses and participants
as often bordering on an organized mob.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
To keep the capital at Omaha was the watchword
on the one side and to take it away the
battle-cry on the other. Money and town-lot
stock are said to have played an important
part with members who seem to have anticipated
later-day legislative methods and
yielded to "inducements" that overcame their
local loyalty. While the Capitol building rose
on Capitol Hill, Omaha had to contest for its
retention at every annual session of the Legislature
from 1855 to 1858, from which time it
was left in undisputed possession until 1867,
when with the investiture of Statehood a seat
of government was carved anew on the virgin
prairie to be christened Lincoln after the martyred
President.</p>

<p>The great impetus that sent the infant
Omaha forward by leaps and bounds ahead
of its rivals in the Missouri Valley north and
south came from two closely connected enterprises&mdash;the
one the building of the Pacific
telegraph, the other the construction of the
first transcontinental railroad.</p>

<p>The Pacific telegraph assumed tangible form
through the unquenchable energies of Edward
Creighton. Still in the prime of sturdy man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>hood,
invigorated by the Irish blood inherited
from his ancestry, Creighton had come to
Omaha in 1856 to visit his brothers, engaging
for a time in the lumber business. In 1860
he built the Missouri &amp; Western line from St.
Louis to Omaha, but already a year before
had evolved a plan for a telegraph from the
Missouri River to the Pacific coast. With
the encouragement and material assistance of
men like Jeptha H. Wade, Ezra Cornell, and
Hiram Sibley, whose confidence he earned
and kept, his idea, originally received as a
weird fancy, took shape in surveys, contracts,
and actual construction, the first message
transmission occurring in October, 1861, speeding
on in an hour by electric current intelligence
that would previously have required
weeks and months to journey. The fortune
sprung from this venturesome undertaking has
given the name of Creighton a foundation lasting
to the end of time. Edward Creighton
died in 1874, leaving $1,500,000 to be bestowed
eventually for educational and charitable
purposes. The good work he began
has been carried further by his brother, John
A. Creighton, and the Creighton College, the
Creighton Medical School, and the Creighton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
Memorial Hospital, not to enumerate smaller
benefactions, all attest as enduring monuments
the activity and foresight that paved
the way for the electric fluid to flow unchecked
from ocean
to ocean.</p>

</div>

<p>The telegraph
was
but the forerunner
of
the railroad.
With Omaha
the initial
point of the
Pacific telegraph
lines,
it enjoyed a
marked advantage
in
the competition
for the
eastern terminus of the Pacific Railway. Up
to that time, all transportation had been by
steamboat up the Missouri River or in wagon
and coach overland. The race of the iron
horse across Iowa had been interrupted, first
by the financial crash of 1857, and then by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
war of 1861, so that the first locomotive to
carry its train to the Missouri River arrived
January 17, 1867, bearing the escutcheon of
the Chicago &amp; Northwestern. Within two
years four railroads converged at the river
opposite Omaha eager to share the through
transcontinental traffic already in sight.</p>

<p>The history of Omaha and of the Union
Pacific is inseparably linked. It is not necessary
to weigh the conflicting claims to credit
for suggesting the railroad to the Pacific slope.
The war demonstrated the military necessity
of a rail connection with the coast States and
forced Congress to take the steps that made
its immediate construction possible. Without
the subsidy offered in the Acts of 1862 and
1863 the road certainly would not have been
built for years, and the development of the
whole western country would have been long
retarded.</p>

<p>At the recommendation of the chief engineer,
Peter A. Dey, the eastern terminus was
fixed "on the western boundary of the State
of Iowa, opposite Omaha," an event so auspicious
as to provoke a responsive demonstration
from the enthusiastic inhabitants of the young
city, who made the master-stroke of their cele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>bration
the actual breaking of the ground for
the newly projected road. This occurred December
2, 1863, with the thermometer hovering
close to the freezing point.</p>

<p>The work of construction was pushed with
all possible rapidity, but with the best expedition
it was May 10, 1869, before the juncture
of the two roads heading for one another
from east and west was effected, in the presence
of a distinguished body of spectators, by
the driving of the golden spike at Promontory
Point, girding the continent with
bands of steel. According to all accounts the
celebration at Omaha of the completion of the
Union Pacific was on a scale commensurate
with its importance to the commercial and industrial
position of the city.</p>

<p>If Engineer Dey was the central figure in the
initial work, Thomas C. Durant, as First Vice-President
and General Manager, had more to do
with its successful completion than any other
one man. While many names have since shown
bright in the progress of this epoch-making enterprise,
those of Dey and Durant must form
the base-stones of the arch that has raised this
great railroad to its eminence, and carried it
through stress and storm.</p>

<p>With a firmly established industrial foundation,
the progress of the city has gone steadily
forward. Commercial expansion, it is true,
has been broken occasionally by bursting real-estate
booms, grasshopper plagues, drought-stricken
crops or general financial depression,
but in material welfare and ever-widening
public activity the community takes rank with
its most wide-awake competitors. Besides its
extensive jobbing interests, its manufacturing
development has been along the lines of silver
smelting and refining, linseed oil mills, white
lead works, machine and locomotive shops, and
the great live-stock market and meat-packing
establishments that have formed the nucleus
of the magic city braced against its boundary
under the name of South Omaha, and sure,
sooner or later, to be one with it in corporate
existence, as it is already in life and business.
Although not yet past the fiftieth anniversary,
Omaha boasts of all those advantages that make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
an attractive living place&mdash;good schools, well-stocked
free libraries, substantial churches, art
galleries, well-paved streets, with water, light,
and rapid transit, fine public parks, imposing
public buildings. Above all, it is a city of
homes and home owners, thick with modest
dwellings though only meagrely supplied with
palatial mansions. Omaha's contribution to
the world of science, art, and literature is
perhaps small, but it has given two presidents
to the American Bar Association in James
M. Woolworth and Charles F. Manderson,
the latter also having filled the position of
President <i>pro tem</i>. of the United States
Senate; in banking circles Herman Kountze
and Joseph H. Millard are known throughout
the country; Edward Rosewater and
his newspaper, <i>The Bee</i>, occupy a place in
the front rank of American journalism; the
art gallery of George Whininger is classed
among the best private collections on this side
of the Atlantic; and the benevolence of John
A. Creighton has received recognition in the
title conferred on him of Count in the Holy
Roman See.</p>

<p>The Trans-Mississippi Exposition of 1898
constitutes Omaha's crowning achievement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
recent years. Projected in the period of densest
industrial gloom and executed in the face of the
war with Spain, the enterprise proved an unexpected
and unprecedented success, returning
to the stock subscribers ninety per cent of the
money they had advanced. The financial success
was, however, subordinate to the success
in other directions. A white city of such architectural
perfection could not fail to afford an
æsthetic stimulus in itself of wonderful educational
effect. Participated in by all the trans-Mississippi
States and Territories as an
exhibition of the resources and products of
this vast region, the Exposition served to open
the eyes of visitors from both at home and
abroad to the limitless possibilities there spread
before them. The Indian Congress alone, including
as it did representatives of nearly all
the remaining tribes of aboriginal inhabitants
gathered together under the direction of the
Indian authorities of the Federal Government,
formed an ethnic object-lesson the like of
which had never before been presented. No
fitter culmination could have been prepared
than the Peace Jubilee, in its closing month of
October, attended by President McKinley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
members of his Cabinet, and heroes of the

acclaiming the end of war typified in the Exposition

<h2>DENVER<br />

THE QUEEN CITY OF THE PLAINS</h2>

<p class="chapby">By JOHN COTTON DANA</p>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">D</span>ENVER has historic background. Behind
its own brief chronicles we note the
outline of the story, full of the good work of
strong men, of the exploration and civic conquest
of the wide country between the Mississippi
River and the Pacific coast. To ask of
Denver's beginnings is to go back of 1858 and
the hopeful Aurarians by the ford at the mouth
of Cherry Creek, to government explorations,
California gold seekers, Mormon emigrants,
trappers and traders, and Spanish pioneers.</p>

<p>The incidents which lead up to Denver's
origin took place here and there in a great
mid-continental area so vast as to make those
incidents seem at first sight isolated, unrelated
to one another. But there is a simplicity of
plan in that great country which, taken with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
the gold of the west coast and the migrant
spirit of the early settlers of the Mississippi
Valley, makes the early ventures across the
plains seem natural enough and binds them to
one another. Given the country and the factors
mentioned, and a great central city, at
once a focus and distributing point for all that
lay across the plains, the Denver of to-day,
was foreordained.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_469.jpg"> Sources of Territorial Acquisitionof Colorado.</a><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427"></a></div>

<p>Westward of the Mississippi lie six hundred
miles of plains, fertile and attractive on their
eastern edge, a desert waste beyond, ending
abruptly in rocky mountains. The mountains,
dropping here and there into high and barren
tablelands, roll on a thousand miles to the
Pacific. From the Canadian to the Mexican
boundary, plains and mountains thus dispose
themselves and make the arena for the drama
of the Anglo-Saxon conquest of the new West,&mdash;a
conquest of a not too unwilling nature by
energetic and efficient men. The scene was
remote; the land, generous when once subdued,
was repellent if not hostile in its aspect,
and added to the barrier of a desert waste
upon its border the deterrents and terrors of
the unknown. The Indians who claimed the
soil&mdash;chiefly Arapahoes and their allies
near Denver, and their hereditary foes, the
Utes, in the mountains&mdash;did all in their power
to make a seemingly inhospitable nature yet
more inhospitable. They were never large in
number. They were foredoomed to defeat.
Their presence in this vast area added more
of romance than of difficulty and danger to
the coming of the white man. Some of their
travel-worn paths among the mountains, like
the old Navajo trail of Southwest Colorado,
may still be traced, can still arouse sympathetic
interest in a people for whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
modern man could not wait, and despised
as laggard. From Aztec Springs, across Lost
Cañon, over the Dolores River near its big
bend, out upon Dolores Plateau to Narraguinnep
Spring and the borders of Disappointment
Valley, and then on and on again,
so runs the old Navajo trail; here a single
foot-path up the cañon side, there deep triple
and quadruple ruts worn by men, women,
horses, and dragging teepee poles. With no
signs of permanent habitation on its way, out
of wild nature it comes, into wild nature it
goes; significant of the passing of the people
who made it and of the petty trace they left on
the world about them.</p>

<p>The Spanish had carried their religion and
their rule up into the southern margin of this
great area long before the first settlements were
made on Massachusetts Bay. Coronado pushed
as far northeast as Kansas in 1541. The towns
which the Spanish established, many of them
three centuries and more ago, led to the brief
romance of the old Santa Fé trail, and still
give a peculiar flavor to the story of the
southern border. But save for a few small
towns whose lack of root in the soil is evidenced
by the ruins of their churches&mdash;churches so
far forgotten that our own historians have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
called them remains of prehistoric times&mdash;the
Spanish invasion was an invasion always, not
a settlement, not an appropriation of even the
margin of the vast area we are considering.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_471.jpg"> DENVER, COLORADO.</a><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429"></a></div>

<p>Lewis and Clark went northwest to the
Columbia in 1803; Pike went up the Arkansas
in 1806; and that young man's simple tale of
the things he dared and the sights he saw in
his march from the Mississippi to the lone fort
he built on the banks of the Conejos in the
San Luis Valley is charming and adventurous.
He was the American pioneer of the future
Colorado. Wandering trappers and hunters
had preceded him; but none told what they
had seen.</p>

<p>Long, with his expedition, in July, 1820,
crossed the spot where Denver now stands.
Long was an explorer, not a pioneer. Pioneers
are prophets, and see the fences and
barns that are to come. To Long all west of
the Missouri,</p>

<blockquote><p>"agreeably to the best intelligence that can be had ...
is throughout uninhabitable by a people depending
upon agriculture for their subsistence.... This region,
however," he says, "viewed as a frontier, may
prove of infinite importance to the United States, inasmuch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
as it is calculated to serve as a barrier to prevent
too great an extension of our population westward, and
secure us against the machinations or incursions of an
enemy, that might otherwise be disposed to annoy us in
that quarter."</p></blockquote>

<p>This opinion, widely circulated, perhaps
helped to defer
the day of actual
occupation of
that Great American
Desert
which, after
Long's report,
took possession,
on our maps, of
nearly all the
country whose
history is Denver's
prehistoric
days.</p>

<p>Then came Sublette and his like, and the
Rocky Mountain Fur Company, the Santa Fé
trail, trappers, Indians; and these also, beginning
about 1822, would furnish material for
romance, were the simple story thereof not
romance enough.</p>

<p>Bonneville in 1832 vanished from sight in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
the Northwest for three years; and many
others, among them Irving, Bonneville's historian,
sought profit, adventure, or knowledge
in the new land. In '42, Frémont, the Pathfinder,
on his first expedition pushed out
nearly to the site of Denver. And Frémont's
travels, the romantic note in them heightened
by the presence of Kit Carson, prince of pioneers,&mdash;what
color they add to our chronicles
of exploration! Five times he set forth. Once
he camped on the site of Denver, with 160
lodges of Arapahoe Indians near by. Once
he nearly perished with all his party in the
Sangre de Cristo range.</p>

<p>Kearney's military expedition to Santa Fé
at the time of the Mexican War; Gunnison's
exploration for a railroad route to the Pacific,
in 1853; Marcy's incredible midwinter march
from Fort Bridger, across the very backbone
of the continent, south to New Mexico; all
these were great deeds, and all served to add to
that knowledge of the still wild West which
brought about its final conquest.</p>

<p>To speak feelingly of the Mormon exodus,
of that venture into the western wilderness
of a few men of our own blood and faith, is to
be misunderstood. Some day that flight of<span class="pagenum">[433]</span>
a few brave exiles for conscience sake, from
their brother men to the heart of a continent,
where a relentless nature seemed, with her
isolation and her desolation, doubly equipped
for cruelty&mdash;some day that flight, worthily
and justly told, will find a place in history.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>
<p>The gold seekers of California, who crossed
by thousands the land the outline of whose
human history we are trying to sketch, these
have, perhaps, received their due.</p>

<p>Such, then, in broadest outline, is the background
of Denver's history. It is almost depressing
to consider how little the outline
holds of that recognition element which makes
"historic" for us a country, a scene, a person,
an event. Here is a wide and wonderful
country; here have been done great deeds by
brave and true men. Coronado, Escalante,
Pike, Lewis and Clark, among explorers;
Kit Carson, Jim Bridger, the Bents, Jim
Baker, among scouts, trappers, and traders;
the names could be multiplied many
times. Their deeds are fit to provoke emulation
or national pride. But mention of either
names or deeds stirs the emotions only of
the few. This is inevitable. They are not
yet part of universal knowledge. They are
not yet types of men or actions, as are Ulysses,
Agamemnon, Hampden, and the voyage
of the <i>Mayflower</i>. Things are not "historic"
until later generations have made them so.
Perhaps the dominance of Old World types
in literature and art, together with the swift<span class="pagenum">[435]</span>
rush of affairs of the passing day, will crowd
much of the story of America's development
out from the domain of history as known to
men at large. If so, the story of the taking
by our forebears and our brothers of the great
West beyond the Mississippi will always remain
as little "historic," as barren in its emotional
content, as it is to-day. This were a
pity, tho' perhaps best. But even then it
would seem proper to suggest, in the bare
outline I have drawn, the historic possibilities
which lie back of, lead up to, explain, the
Denver of to-day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_477.jpg"> FIRST SCHOOLHOUSE IN DENVER.</a><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435"></a></div>

<p>It is 1857; the country has become vaguely
known, many have crossed it; the Mormons
have taken possession of the Salt Lake basin;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
from the mountains across the plains there
float back rumors of gold; and the region
which has been simply a desert to be crossed
begins to be a region to be explored, perhaps
to be settled. Who first found gold it is idle
to inquire. A party of Cherokees from the
gold regions of Georgia were perhaps the first
to get traces on the Platte. Certain men of
Lawrence, Kansas, prophets perhaps, boomers
probably, certainly addicted to the town-site
habit, and abounding in hope, went up the Arkansas
in 1858; tried to start a town on Monument
Creek under the shadow of Pike's Peak;
wearied soon of waiting for a population which
did not come, and crossed the divide north to
the Platte; staked out a town, Montana, on
that stream a few miles above the site of Denver,
and disbanded. Of this party a few moved
down the Platte to the mouth of Cherry Creek,
and there in the bottom, among the cotton-woods,
just where the old military road crossed
the creek, laid out the town of St. Charles.
Another party, from Iowa, in the same year,
settled across the creek on its west side and
soon laid out a town and called it Auraria.
Then came another party over the divide from
the Arkansas, found the St. Charles town-site<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
promoters were absent, saw the city that was
to be, jumped the site, and organized a company
to build a town thereon to be called Denver
in honor of the then Governor of Kansas.
And so, in the winter of 1858-59 Denver found
itself, on what proved to be "Section 33 and
the west half of section 34, in township 3 south
of range 68 west of the 6th principal meridian."
How fatal to the romantic element in the beginnings
of the Western city are the transit and
the chain! What can there be of mystery or
poetry in "Sec. 33 and W. 1/2 of Sec. 34, Tp. 3
S. of R. 68 W. 6th P.M."?</p>

<p>Denver was a rival of Auraria. Her supremacy
was settled early in 1859 by thirty
wagons which came up the Platte and unloaded
their merchandise on the Denver side of Cherry
Creek. In the spring of 1859 a large company,
perhaps 1000, were already camped in and
about the new towns. The Pike's Peak excitement
became intense. A new gold fever was
on. Mr. William N. Byers reached Denver
April 21, 1859, with a printing outfit and issued
the first number of the first paper printed in
Colorado, April 23d. On his way across he met
the returning tide. Report says 150,000 started
that spring across the plains; 50,000 turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
back; 100,000 went on to the mountains; not
over 40,000 of them stayed. The early months
of 1859 were troublous times. Foolish, reckless
gold seekers, led West on half-knowledge,
tried to lay the blame for their own folly on the
shoulders of others. Gold in paying quantities
was as yet far from common. Horace
Greeley crossed the plains in July, looked over
the ground with care, reported favorably on
the country in the <i>Tribune</i>, and, in good local
phrase, "gave Denver the best advertisement
she ever had."</p>

<p>The city, now under way, attained little importance
until after 1870. Rival trade centres
attracted attention. Mining camps scattered
through the mountains drew most of the population.
After the Leadville excitement in 1878
and 1879, it rose in 1880 to 35,000, by fairly
steady growth to 106,000 in 1890, was checked
by the panic and hard times about 1893, and
yet rose to 133,000 in 1900.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_481.jpg"> FACSIMILE LETTER FROM WM. N. BYERS, THE FOUNDER OF
THE "ROCKY MOUNTAIN NEWS."</a><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439"></a></div>

<p>Once established as the leading distributing
point of the mining regions of the New West
the city's growth was assured, and followed in
the main the lines of many other Western cities.
Peculiar to itself were a few incidents due to
its position, to ignorance of the climate, its
isolation and the difficulty of extending Eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
railways to so remote a point. Early in 1863
a great fire destroyed much of the business
portion of the city. The summer following, the
plains were burned by a terrible drought. The
barrenness of the wide stretches about the city
was intensified. To this day the sun-burnt
plains of midsummer sweep up to Denver's
very door-yards, mock at the blue sky above
them, and speak unutterable things of hunger,
thirst, and death. In the early '60's it was easy
to imagine that they spoke in earnest. Then
came a winter, cold beyond all experience.
Many suffered. Cattle died. The pride some
had felt over the balminess of previous winters
was forgotten. With early spring, Cherry
Creek, the miserable, despised bed of sand
which crept through the town, scorned as a
possible stream and used for building sites
over all its wide bottom, rose in fury, rolled
down from the divide, swept away the cheap
bridges that simply served to aggravate
the flood, killed twenty persons, and destroyed
nearly a million dollars' worth of
property. Nor was this the end of troubles.
For in 1864 the Indians planned a general
massacre, killed a few people near Denver, destroyed
stage stations, cut off communication
with the East, and left Denver unspeakably
alarmed and with only six weeks' supply of
food.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_483.jpg"> PROSPECTING PARTY, RICO, COLORADO, 1880.</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441"></a></span></div>

<p>In these first years gold seemed the one excuse
for the white man's presence in Colorado.
Several million dollars were taken out from
easily worked placer mines before 1863. The
supply then seemed exhausted. All efforts to
get the gold from veins were ineffectual.
Millions were spent by the overzealous in
machinery and mills not adapted to the country's
needs. But over this, as over all other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
obstacles, the triumph was sure; and by 1871
new and proper processes of mining and ore
reducing had been successfully adopted.</p>

<p>The fertility of Colorado soil under irrigation
was not realized fully for nearly a decade after
the founding of Denver. But before 1870 the
agricultural possibilities were demonstrated;
the cattle industry continued to thrive; and
the region north of Denver lying under the
several streams which issue from the mountains
within sight of the city began to grow
into the garden spot it now is, and to lend
stability to Denver's factors of growth.</p>

<p>The Union Pacific reached the city via
Cheyenne in June, 1870, and the Kansas Pacific
soon after. Of that wonderful railway to
whose growth Denver owes so much, the Denver
&amp; Rio Grande, the first rails were laid
in 1871.</p>

<p>What is now Colorado was variously known
in early days of its settlement as "Pike's
Peak," "Arapahoe County," "Jefferson Territory."
The story of the settlement of its
governmental difficulties; its miners' and its
people's courts; its independent government;
the dramatic career of that prophet of the
great divide, William Gilpin, first Governor<span class="pagenum">[443]</span>
of Colorado, in his headstrong yet wise handling
of difficult problems in the opening days
of the Civil War,&mdash;all this is full of interest,
of excitement, of adventure, is instructive to
the student of institutions, and full of confirmation
for those who have faith in the civic
genius of the American people.</p>

<p>What one
may call the natural
history of
Denver's people is interesting and, perhaps,
explanatory of some things in its history. To
it have come in good measure the vigorous
and energetic. They have brought with them
the ideas and customs of all parts of the
United States. In the first two decades, the
formative period, about half of all comers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
from the upper Mississippi Valley, largely of
New England descent; and one fourth each
from the extreme East and the South. Among
these were many invalids. All were young;
and old men are still rare in Denver. Put
these elements together in a climate of sunshine
and dry tonic air; separate them by
six hundred miles from all that is old and conventional;
give them wide opportunity of
choice in occupation,&mdash;agriculture, stock raising,
mining of precious metals, iron, coal, and
stone, and the building of a city and a State;
let their city be&mdash;much as Paris is France&mdash;politically,
socially, and financially, the entire
State, containing, as it does, nearly one third
of all the latter's population;&mdash;and you may
look for, and you will find, courage, swiftness
of execution, easy adjustment of conflicting
ideas and habits, tolerance on all matters
save those affecting general local interests,
where a certain natural State patriotism
blooms into a fine bigotry, quick adoption of
all modern improvements in living, and a
readiness to try any promising social experiment.
You would expect politics to be continually
threatened with reform; an occasional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
economic heresy to get a passing boom; newspapers
to be wide-awake, vituperative, and not
greatly influential. And you would expect to
find Denver, as you do find it, a brilliant, active,
inspiring city, full of promise in itself and
possessed by a people who&mdash;being chiefly
of American stock and wrought upon by a
climate which is the climate of the States intensified&mdash;in
their alertness and in their intensity
perhaps speak of the American citizen
as this continent of ours will sometime mould
him.</p>

<h2>SANTA FÉ<br />

THE CITY OF THE HOLY FAITH</h2>

<p class="chapby">By FREDERICK WEBB HODGE</p>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">T</span>HERE is probably no settlement within our
domain over the history of which so much
mystery has hovered as the capital of New
Mexico. Some historical writers early claimed
for the ancient city a reputation for antiquity
exceeding that of St. Augustine, Florida; others
were content to give it second place in point
of age, and this position it really holds, notwithstanding
the strong but groundless belief,
still somewhat prevalent, that Santa Fé had a
teeming aboriginal population when the Spaniards
under Coronado first made their appearance
in New Mexico in 1540.</p>

<p>The actual founder of Santa Fé, so far as we
can determine, was Juan de Oñate, a wealthy
resident of Zacatecas, who married Doña Isabel,
granddaughter of Hernan Cortés, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
great-granddaughter of Montezuma, the Aztec
chief. In the autumn of 1595 Oñate was
granted authority and viceregal support to
raise an army and to explore and colonize New
Mexico, but the intrigues of his rivals caused
many delays and it was not until February,
1598, that, with a force of some four hundred
colonists, accompanied by eighty-three wagons
and seven thousand cattle, he was ready to
proceed from the Rio Conchas in Chihuahua,
bound for the Rio Grande del Norte and New
Mexico.</p>

<p>It is not essential to follow the little army in
its northward journeying up the river, across
the terrible Jornada del Muerto,&mdash;where, as
scores of times later, the bones of some were
left to whiten the trail. The new country was
formally taken possession of, for the fifth time
at least, in the name of the King of Spain, and
on July 11, 1598, Oñate with his vanguard
reached the still inhabited Indian pueblo of
San Juan, some thirty miles northwest of the
present Santa Fé.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_493.jpg"> THE SO-CALLED "OLDEST HOUSE" IN SANTA FÉ.</a><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451"></a></div>

<p>A month later work was begun with Indian
aid on the construction of ditches to supply
water for a new settlement, the site for which
had been selected at the confluence of the Rio
Chama with the Rio Grande, on the west bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
of the latter stream, where the hamlet of Chamita
now stands. On August 23d the erection of
a chapel for this new town of San Francisco de
los Españoles was begun; it was finished
September 7th, and on the following day was
consecrated.</p>

<p>This town, which was built on the site of the
abandoned Tewa pueblo of Yukewingge (or
Yuqueyunque as Coronado's chroniclers called
it in 1541), was thus the first European settlement
in New Mexico, and the second within the
limits of the United States. In 1599 the village
became known as San Gabriel, a name
which it retained for several years.</p>

<p>The exact date of the founding of Santa Fé
is not known, ignorance of the fact probably
being due to the destruction by the Indians of
the local Spanish archives in 1680. In
October, 1604, Oñate started on a journey
to the head of the Gulf of California,
returning to San Gabriel on April 25,
1605. The return route took the explorer
past El Morro, or "Inscription Rock," thirty-five
miles east of Zuñi, where he carved his
name on April 16th. It seems likely that the
building of Santa Fé was begun shortly after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>ward,
although there is also good authority that
San Gabriel remained the only settlement of
Europeans until 1608, in which year, it is said,
the Crown fixed the governmental regulations
of the province and assigned a salary of two
thousand ducats a year to the Governor, who
immediately departed for Santa Fé. About
this time Oñate was relieved by Governor Pedro
de Peralta.</p>

<p>The prospects of the new capital during its
infancy were not promising. Although the
Franciscan missionaries manifested such zeal
that by 1617 eleven churches had been established
in New Mexico and fourteen thousand
natives are said to have been baptized, there
were only forty-eight soldiers and colonists in
the entire province. On January 3, 1617, the
King was petitioned to grant succor to the
settlement, and by royal decree of May 20,
1620, his Majesty ordered the Viceroy to
render the necessary aid, with the result that by
1630 it was recorded by Fray Alonso de
Benavides that the town contained 250 Spaniards
(some fifty of whom were armed), in
addition to seven hundred Indians, "so that,
between Spaniards, half-breeds, and Indians,
there must be a thousand souls." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
expense of the garrison was not borne by the
Crown, but by means derived from an <i>encomienda</i>,
or trusteeship over the Indians, who
paid an annual tribute of a vara of cotton
cloth and a fanega of corn per family in return
for their teaching and "civilization."</p>

<p>As at San Gabriel, among the first structures
reared in the new town was a chapel.
The first edifice of this character was an unpretentious
affair, a mere hut, which served
its purpose until 1622, when Benavides, having
become Father Custodian of the province,
commenced to build a new church and monastery
which, after its completion in 1627,
"would shine in whatsoever place." This is
believed to have been the Parroquia, which
stood on the site of the present cathedral;
indeed, some of the walls of the old building
are incorporated in the present structure.
The chapel of San Miguel, greatly modified
in recent years, dates from the middle of the
seventeenth century; while the Capilla de
los Soldados, which formerly faced the plaza,
opposite the Palace, with its grand altar tablet
erected by Governor Francisco Antonio
Marin del Valle in 1761, probably dates from
about 1730.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_497.jpg"> FORT MARCY AND THE PARROQUIA IN 1846.</a><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455"></a></div>

<p>As already mentioned, there is no ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
for the belief that Santa Fé was established at
a populous Indian pueblo,&mdash;the "capital" of
all the village dwellers of New Mexico,&mdash;the
only excuse for such belief, still popular in
New Mexico, being that, in prehistoric times,
the town was the site of at least one Indian
pueblo.</p>

<p>Of the history of Santa Fé between Benavides's
time (1622-1630) and the year 1680
not much is known. More than a dozen governors
served the kingdom of Spain in the
administration of the affairs of the colony during
this period, and knowledge of the geography
was somewhat increased by expeditions
from the seat of government into parts little
known. The Pueblo Indians, always friendly
when well treated, cherished the religion of
their fathers, which the Spaniards tried in every
way to supplant, so that comparatively little
progress was made in this rich missionary field
aside from the erection of massive churches
of stone and adobe and the baptism of many
of the natives. Jealousy arose between the
civil and ecclesiastical authorities, and so
bitter became the feeling that the friars were
accused of inciting a rebellion of the Indians
in 1642, which resulted in the killing of Governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
Luis Rosas. Henceforward the hatred
of the natives for the whites became deeper
and deeper; many of the natives were hanged
from time to time for alleged religious offences,
and in 1675 many others were whipped
and imprisoned. From this time affairs assumed
such a serious aspect that the sedentary
tribes, under the leadership of Popé, a
native of San Juan pueblo, finally determined
to throw off the Spanish yoke by effecting
an organization that is still noteworthy in
Indian annals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_499.jpg"> SAN MIGUEL CHAPEL BEFORE RECONSTRUCTION.</a><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457"></a></div>

<p>Popé was a medicine-man of no mean capacity.
His story of the wrongs of his people
fell on eager ears, and it was not long ere his
plan to exterminate the Spaniards received
support from all the northerly Pueblo tribes.
The day of reckoning was to have been August
13th, while the mystic means of communication
was a knotted yucca cord which
was dispatched by fleet runners to the outlying
tribes. Although all were enjoined to the
strictest secrecy, treachery lurked in the Indian
ranks, and before the time allotted for
the outbreak the Spaniards became aware of
its approach through neophytes loyal to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
cause. Popé saw that immediate action was
necessary to the fulfilment of his designs;
news that the secret had been divulged was
heralded afar in true Indian fashion, and on
August 10th, three days before the time originally
fixed, more than four hundred of the
twenty-five hundred settlers, soldiers, and
friars were cruelly massacred.</p>

<p>On the 13th the refugees at Santa Cruz were
taken to Santa Fé, and on the day following
the enemy appeared in the suburb of Analco,
in the vicinity of the present chapel of San
Miguel, which had been erected for the Tlascalan
or Mexican members of the colony. A
parley was held with a deputation of the Indians,
who bore a white cross of peace and a
red cross of war: of these they gave the Spaniards
their choice, but on condition that if
the former were selected their country must be
immediately evacuated. Every effort was
made by the Spaniards to bring about peace,
but the Indians, encouraged by the success of
their bloody enterprise, were determined to
drive the Spaniards forever from the home of
their fathers.</p>

<p>Failing in his efforts at conciliation, Governor
Otermin endeavored to dislodge the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
natives from the outskirts; but already the
warriors had arrived by hundreds, and the first
desperate effort of the Spaniards to drive off
the natives resulted in their own retirement
to the great adobe Palace where the surviving
women and children had already taken refuge.</p>

<p>The siege continued until the 19th. The
Indians grew bolder with the continued arrival
of warriors until three thousand were massed
in the outskirts of the town. The city was
beleaguered; the chapel of San Miguel had
been destroyed, and the water-supply of the
town cut off; consequently the trembling thousand
within the Palace walls under the protection
of only a hundred armed men were in
desperate straits. The 19th passed. Otermin
and his imprisoned colonists spent the night
in planning the escape which seemed almost
impossible. On the following day the brave
hundred made a sortie which met with such
success that three hundred of the enemy were
slain, and nearly fifty captured and afterward
hanged in the plaza, while the main body was
driven in confusion to the heights. The Indians
became demoralized by this first blow,
thus affording the Spaniards the opportunity,
on August 21st, of gathering their belongings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
and starting on their march of six weeks
down the river, under a midsummer's sun and
through a ravaged country, to the mission of
Guadalupe near the present El Paso, Texas.</p>

<p>The Pueblos were at last in possession of
Santa Fé and of the dearly bought independence
which they had so long been craving. Everything
Spanish was laid aside under strict taboo&mdash;the
language of the white man was to be
forgotten and his religion forever buried; his
houses of worship and the civil and ecclesiastical
archives were to be fed to the flames, and
their own rites revived in the ceremonial
chambers which the Spaniards had caused to
be abandoned; even the clothing and the
crops of the foreigners were to be discarded,
and only indigenous products consumed as of
old, while soap-weed and the rivulet which
flows through Santa Fé provided the means for
effacing their baptism into Christianity. The
Palace (which then occupied the entire block
north of the plaza) seems to have been at
least partially spared and was occupied by the
Tanos of Galisteo, who built a kiva or ceremonial
chamber in its courtyard.</p>

<p>More than one attempt was made to reconquer
the province and to re-establish the seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
of government during the next few years, but
nothing of marked importance was accomplished
until after Diego de Vargas Zapata
Lujan Ponce de Leon became Governor in
1691. Accompanied by some sixty soldiers,
one hundred Indians, and three friars, Vargas
started up the Rio Grande from El Paso
August 21, 1692, and on September 13th appeared
before Santa Fé with part of his force.
The fortified Tanos at first showed hostility,
but moral suasion soon resulted in effecting
their surrender and even in inducing the apostates
to renew allegiance and to submit to baptism.
Vargas then withdrew for the purpose
of extending the conquest over other parts,
and it was not until October, 1693, that he
was enabled to gather his force of a hundred
soldiers, and to renew the journey from El
Paso with the seventy families and seventeen
friars (about eight hundred souls) who were to
form the new colony. On December 16th
the little army entered Santa Fé under the
very banner borne by Oñate nearly a century
before. Although the Tanos were now found
to be friendly in the main, they manifested
little enthusiasm in providing the Spaniards
with food, or in rendering aid in the restora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>tion
of San Miguel Chapel, offering, however,
their pagan kiva for the white man's worship.</p>

<p>It was midwinter, and, the altitude being
over seven thousand feet, many children perished.
As the Indians were occupying the
official quarters and such of the dwellings as
had not been razed, they were ordered back
to Galisteo, but refused to go. Their stronghold
was attacked; re-enforcements from the
kindred Tewas arrived, but the combined
force was overpowered, seventy prisoners
were made an example of, and four hundred
women and children were distributed among
the colonists. Hostilities continued with the
outlying tribes until September, 1694, but
before the year closed the missionaries were
enabled to resume their fields of labor.</p>

<p>The winter of 1695-96 was one of discontent
by reason of a failure of the crops
during the previous season. This probably
in large measure was the cause of another
revolt in the following June, when twenty-six
Spaniards, including five friars, were murdered;
and not until the new century dawned
were the last embers of the rebellion smothered.
Vargas's term as Governor expired in
1696; but he remained in Santa Fé, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
serious charges were preferred against him
by his successor, Cubero, which resulted in
his imprisonment until 1700. In 1703 he
was reappointed Governor, but died April
8, 1704, and was buried in the Parroquia,
which meanwhile had been restored to its former
condition. San Miguel Chapel remained
in ruins until 1708, when its restoration was
commenced by Governor José Chacon Medina
Salazar y Villaseñor, Marqués de Peñuela.
The edifice was completed in 1710, as the
following inscription on a gallery beam still
testifies:</p>

<blockquote><p>EL SEÑOR MARQUÉS DE LA
PEÑUELA HIZO ESTA FÁBRICA:
EL ALFÉREZ REAL DON AGUSTIN
FLORES VERGARA SU CRIADO. AÑO
DE 1710.</p></blockquote>

<p>The eighteenth century was marked by expeditions
from Santa Fé in various directions
(including one in the year of American Independence
that resulted in the discovery of
Utah Lake), which added materially to geographic
knowledge of the period; by an
extension of missionary work among some
tribes and the chastisement of others who had
been conducting their raids uncomfortably
close to the capital with its little garrison of<span class="pagenum">[465]</span>
eighty soldiers; and by controversies between
the authorities of Church and State which did
not tend to promote the peace of mind of
either side or of the colonists.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_507.jpg"> SAN MIGUEL CHAPEL IN 1899.
FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY A.C. VROMAN, PASADENA, CAL.</a><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465"></a></div>

<p>In 1767 a freshet so seriously threatened
the town that the citizens were called to divert
the course of the stream and thus saved the
settlement. As in the case of a previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
proposal to move the capital to Sia, it was
planned in 1780 to transfer the seat of government
to Santo Domingo, but Governor
Ugarte decided against the project and expended
two thousand pesos in improving the
plan of the town and in establishing a presidio
therein. Before the middle of the century
French-Canadian traders had found their way
to the Rio Grande, and sporadic bartering
with the plains Indians gradually developed
into the important industry later known as
the "commerce of the prairies." A brisk
trade also sprang up between New Mexico
and Chihuahua, which in 1780 aggregated
$30,000 in value. Santa Fé, therefore, at
an early period became the seat of an inland
commerce, mainly in sheep, wool, wine,
and pelts. In 1804 William Morrison of
Kaskaskia dispatched to New Mexico a consignment
of goods, which were confiscated;
various attempts to introduce merchandise
from the United States during the next few
years shared a like fate, the participants
usually being imprisoned. This action on the
part of the New Mexican officials was later
probably more or less due to the ill-feeling
engendered by the exploit of Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
Zebulon M. Pike, who in January, 1807, while
conducting an exploration under military
orders, erected a stockade fort in Spanish
territory. He
and his command
were arrested,
conducted
to
Santa Fé, and
later taken to
Chihuahua as
prisoners.</p>

<span class="caption">CHRISTOPHER ("KIT") CARSON.</span>
</div>

<p>But all efforts
to prevent
the inroads of
traders from
the United
States were in
vain; even the
almost prohibitory
duty, for a
time, of $500 per load of merchandise, regardless
of its value, was overcome, and the
overland trade conducted by way of the great
Santa Fé trail, first by pack-animals from
Franklin, and later by wagon from Independence,
Missouri, increased from $15,000 in 1822<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
to $750,000 in 1844. The names of McKnight,
Pursley, Choteau, Beard, Lalande, Chambers,
Cooper, the Bents, Joel Walker, Sublette,
Kit Carson, and many other hardy pioneers
will long be remembered in the early history
of the old Santa Fé trail.</p>

<p>Santa Fé had so long been the hotbed of revolt
that its inhabitants must have been lonely
for several years without one to engage their
attention. The rebellion of 1837 was due to
political intrigue for which a former Governor,
Manuel Armijo, was held to be largely responsible.
The Pueblo Indians participated as
usual, and the Governor, Albino Perez, as well
as the chief justice and nearly a dozen others,
were wantonly murdered. Santa Fé once more
fell into the hands of the enemy, who elected
José Gonzalez, a Taos Indian, as Governor.
Armijo now deserted the rebel cause, and, raising
a sufficient force to overcome the Gonzalez
faction, declared himself the administrative
head. The revolt was quelled in January, 1838,
Gonzalez and several of his adherents paying
the death penalty, while Armijo's "loyalty"
was rewarded by a confirmation of his self imposed
governorship, which he retained for
eight years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Texas troubles had been
brewing, and discontent prevailed in that quarter
over boundary disputes, and because the
large Santa Fé trade came and went by the
northern route. In 1841, President Lamar
equipped a force, known as the Texan Santa
Fé Expedition, consisting of three hundred
rangers under General McLeod, for the main
purpose of taking New Mexican affairs into
their own hands; but before reaching the
capital the entire "army" was captured by
Armijo's militia, their belongings confiscated,
and the command marched to Mexico, where
they were released in June, 1842.</p>

<p>The Mexican War and American occupancy
followed closely on these exciting episodes.
Save during the brief periods of the arrival and
departure of the caravans at Santa Fé, with the
resultant hubbub and flow of gold, the capital
was more dead than alive. The people, for the
greater part, were densely ignorant; in 1832
there were only half a dozen schools in the
whole territory, and although the salaries of
the Santa Fé teachers aggregated only $500 in
that year, even this sum, from lack of funds, was
unavailable in 1834 and the schools were
closed. By 1844 the only schools were "of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
lowest primary class," and a keen observer asserted
that three fourths of the people were illiterates.
Santa Fé was without a newspaper,
although a sheet called <i>El Crepúsculo</i> ("The
Dawn") was printed at Taos for four weeks in
1835 on the only press then in the territory
of seventy thousand inhabitants. Possibly the
press later found its way to Santa Fé to become
the principal part of the equipment of a
"government printing office" which existed in
one end of the Palace in 1846, and from which
Kearny published his "Code," the first Spanish-English
production of the territory.</p>

<p>In its appearance Santa Fé had changed but
little since 1807, when Pike described its aggregation
of low adobe houses as resembling
from a distance a fleet of flat-bottomed Ohio
river-boats. The Palace occupied then, as it
did early in the seventeenth century and does
to-day, the northern side of the plaza. Besides
being the only building in New Mexico that
could boast the luxury of glass windows, it
contained the governmental offices as of yore,
as well as quarters for the guard and the government
printing office. In Pike's time the
opposite side of the plaza was occupied by the
houses of the clergy and the public officers, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
addition to the military chapel, but with the
advent of trade these gave way, before 1846,
to the shops of merchants and traders.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_513.jpg"> THE OLD PALACE AT SANTA FÉ.</a></div>

<p>General Stephen W. Kearny left Fort
Leavenworth, Kansas, in June, 1846, with his
"Army of the West," comprising about eighteen
hundred men (mostly volunteers), equipped
with a supply train of a thousand mules, and
overtaking <i>en route</i> the Santa Fé caravan
of four hundred wagons. A small force was
sent forward to open the way, and although it
was favorably received, Kearny later learned
that his advance toward the capital would be
contested. Nevertheless, the army continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
its march and entered the town on August
18th without the slightest opposition on the
part of Armijo, who had fled precipitately.
The Stars and Stripes were hoisted over the
Palace, which Kearny made his headquarters,
and the now seasoned volunteers encamped on
an eminence overlooking the town. On the
following day the inhabitants were assembled
in the plaza, where the oath of allegiance was
administered to the former Mexican officials,
including the acting Governor, Juan B. Vigil.
On the 22d Kearny issued his famous proclamation
declaring himself Governor and the
inhabitants of New Mexico citizens of the
United States.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Captain W.H. Emory selected,
as the site for a fort, an eminence on the
northern edge of the town, and the construction
of defensive works was immediately
begun. The fort, named in honor of William
L. Marcy, then Secretary of War, was built
principally of adobe; the only approachable
point was guarded by a blockhouse of pine
logs, and the magazine was erected of the
same material. The embankments of old
Fort Marcy are still plainly traceable, but
there is nothing to mark the graves of<span class="pagenum">[473]</span>
the two hundred brave Missouri volunteers
who were laid to rest at the foot of the slope
during the cruel winter of 1846-47.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_515.jpg"> SANTA FÉ IN 1846.</a><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473"></a></div>

<p>Kearny took almost immediate steps to provide
civil government for New Mexico by appointing
as Governor Charles Bent, who had
for many years been a prominent trader in the
country. But as the months passed many of
the New Mexicans grew tired of their new allegiance,
and conditions ripened for another revolt.
On January 19, 1847, Bent, with other
officials, was foully murdered at Fernandez de
Taos by Mexicans and Taos Indians, but retribution
swift and terrible followed, and the
battle-scarred and ruined church at Taos pueblo
practically repeated the story of the Alamo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<p>Although it remained under military control
until 1850, New Mexico very soon began to
feel the effects of American influence. In
1847 a legislative assembly was held at Santa
Fé; the first English newspaper, <i>The Santa
Fé Republican</i>, was founded, and the New
Mexicans had their first opportunity of becoming
familiar with the mysteries of a sawmill,
which was placed in operation on Santa
Fé Creek. In August, 1848, the treaty of
peace was proclaimed from the Palace, and
the ancient city formally changed masters for
the fifth time in its history. The volunteers
were glad to return to their homes, the Santa
Fé trade resumed its busy march, and modern
ways made further impress on the manners of
the old adobe town. In 1848 the first English
school was put in operation at the capital; later
in the year the <i>New Mexican</i> was founded,
and, save for a few intermissions, has ever
since been published; while the ecclesiastical
importance of the town was augmented by
the establishment of the Roman Catholic
vicariate-apostolic of Santa Fé, with Bishop
Lamy at its head. On March 3, 1851, after
much wrangling and many attempts, New
Mexico was organized into a full-fledged
territory of the United States, James S. Calhoun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
becoming its first civil governor, and on
July 14th the first legislative assembly fixed
Santa Fé as the seat of the new government.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_517.jpg"> THE TERRITORIAL CAPITOL, COMPLETED IN 1900.</a><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475"></a></div>

<p>Next came the Civil War, the principal operations
of which were not so far away that
Santa Fé failed to participate. The severe
defeat of the Federals under Canby by the
Texans under Sibley, at Valverde, in February,
1862 (where Kit Carson's bravery made him a
brigadier), opened the northern way to the
Confederates. Santa Fé was abandoned by the
Union forces on March 3d, and Sibley took
possession a week later. On the 22d Colonel
Slough's Federal force of thirteen hundred men
marched from Fort Union toward the town.
On the 26th the vanguard of four hundred met
the enemy in Apache Cañon, and in the severe
engagements which followed on that day and
on the 28th, the Federals were victorious and
the way was again opened to their occupancy of
Santa Fé on April 11th, the Confederates
having evacuated three days earlier. This
practically closed the war in New Mexico, the
Texans returning to their homes minus half
their number.</p>

<p>The recent years of Santa Fé's history have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
more than ever marked the passage of the
ancient town from the lethargy characteristic
of the century of its founding to the enterprise
which one expects in an American settlement
of the present day. The contrast
between the sleepy Mexican village in the
wilderness during the early years of American
occupancy and the progressive, substantial,
picturesque town of nowadays is vast. The
great awakening came with the first screech
of the locomotive on February 9, 1880, which
forever hushed the rumble of the long caravan
as it rolled its weary way into the crooked
streets of the City of the Holy Faith. New
Mexico's capital was enabled at last to make
the acquaintance of the outer world, although
rival settlements, created by the new trail of
steel, robbed it more and more, as year after
year passed, of the trade which had helped to
make it famous. Its genial climate and other
advantages attracted many from the East;
schools and hospitals were established, and as
the seat of federal and territorial administration,
as well as of military and ecclesiastical importance,
its social advantages became widely
recognized.</p>

<p>Despite its modern buildings devoted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
various uses, there are parts of the town which
have not changed greatly during the half-century
of American influence. The plaza, of
tragic memory, has evolved from a barren
common to a bower of beauty ornamented
with a monument dedicated to the heroes of
Indian and civil strife. The old Palace, in
which the gallant Vargas was dungeoned, and
in which Lew Wallace wrote the last chapters
of <i>Ben Hur</i>, has been refurbished, but probably
no walls within our domain hold in hiding
such a wealth of cruelty and horror, of treachery
and suffering, of valor and chivalry, as the
great adobe structure which still overlooks the
historic plaza of our oldest western town.</p>

<h2>SALT LAKE CITY<br />

THE DESERT THAT HAS BLOSSOMED AS THE
ROSE</h2>

<p class="chapby">By JAMES EDWARD TALMAGE</p>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">L</span>ONG before the first settlement, little
more than fifty years ago, of the valley
of the Great Salt Lake, strange stories of the
briny sea and its desert setting had found their
way to the civilized and cultured East; and,
mingled with the weird accounts of sun-baked
plains, waterless wilderness, and saline solitudes,
were the predictions of the wise that the
country would never be worth settling. This
region was included within the area against
which Daniel Webster hurled his anathema of
denunciation from the floor of the national
Senate, proclaiming the utter worthlessness of
the great West, and declaring that he would
"never vote one cent from the public treasury
to place the Pacific coast one inch nearer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
Boston" than it then was. And concerning
the Salt Lake Valley itself, Colonel James
Bridger, for whom the disputed honor of
discovering the Great Salt Lake has been
claimed, said that he would offer a thousand
dollars in gold for the first ear of corn that
could be ripened therein.</p>

<p>The motive spirit actuating the early travellers
in these then Mexican wastes was that
of exploration and discovery. Worthy as it
was, it was insufficient to induce the settlement
of the wilderness or to inspire the ambition
of subduing the desert and sanctifying
the waste places with the name of home.
The most potent of all incentives, that of
religious conviction and conscientious devotion
to what was regarded as sacred duty,
was necessary&mdash;and not wanting.</p>

<p>It was on the 19th of July, 1847, that the
vanguard of the pioneer party of "Mormon"
colonists sighted the valley of the Great Salt
Lake. For long, weary months they had journeyed;
their start from the frontiers of civilization
had been hastened by the musket and
the sword and the devouring flame of persecution;
their course over plain and mountain
had been attended by vicissitudes that only
those who have toiled through such journeys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
can comprehend.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_523.jpg"> PAVILION OF SALTAIR, GREAT SALT LAKE.</a><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481"></a></div>

<p>And what emotions did that first view of
the "Promised Land" inspire! A valley,
beautiful it is true, even as the desert is beautiful
in its parching splendor; as the mountains
are beautiful in their terrible grandeur;
as the ocean is beautiful in its calm monotony
or in its storm-lashed fury; but such beauty
is not suggestive of rest or peace, and it
was peace the wanderers sought. From the
cañons of the Wasatch, though not the first
to traverse the region, yet the first to brave
its desolate and forbidding seclusion in search
of a home, they looked down on a valley
walled by the Wasatch and the Oquirrhs, bare
of tree or shrub, except for patches of chaparral
oak, and here and there a gnarled willow or
cottonwood bravely struggling for existence
on the upper parts of the few stream courses
that opened from the mountain wall on the
east; the only blossoms those of the stunted
sunflower and its desert companions, the foliage
that of the gray artemisia, or wild sage.</p>

<span class="caption">BRIGHAM YOUNG.
FOUNDER OF SALT LAKE CITY.</span>
</div>

<p>On the 24th of July, 1847, Brigham Young,
the founder of Salt Lake City and the pioneer
colonizer of Utah, descended from the moun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>tain
gateway, followed by the main division of
the company, numbering a hundred and forty
and four souls,
of whom three
were women.
One of this trio
of heroines was
overcome by
the treeless
and desolate
aspect of the
valley. "Weak
and weary as I
am," she said,
"I would rather
go a thousand
miles
farther than
stop in this forsaken place." Three days earlier
an advance detachment, including Orson
Pratt and Erastus Snow, each of whom came
to be known as a prominent apostle of the
"Mormon" Church, had entered the valley;
but July 24th is regarded as the first day of
occupation, and each recurrence of the date
is observed as Pioneer Day, a holiday by law
established in the State of Utah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>

<p>The pioneers' purpose was not uncertain;
having reached their destination they paused
not to make experiments or preliminary tests.
"This is the place," said their leader, "the
very place"; and the company began at once
the work of permanently establishing themselves
and of preparing for the reception of
other immigrant parties then on the march.
Ploughs were promptly brought into action,
and the soil theretofore unused to the husbandman's
touch was in part torn and turned; yet
so hard and resistant was it that it measured
its strength with the energy of man and for
the time held the victory. But the colonists
were full of resource. The little stream now
known as City Creek, the chief source of the
city's water supply, was diverted from its
course and made to flood the land chosen for
the first desert garden. With its long thirst
appeased, its stony heart softened, the virgin
soil yielded and received the first seed sown
by human agency in the Great American Desert.
Thus began the system of irrigation
which in its later developments has proved
itself the magic wand under whose sway the
desert has been conquered and the wilderness
transformed into a garden of beauty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_527.jpg"> EAST TEMPLE STREET, LOOKING SOUTH FROM THE TEMPLE.</a><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485"></a></div>

<p>On the 28th of the same month the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
was planned and its boundaries were indicated;
five days later the survey of the city
plat was begun under the direction of Orson
Pratt. All the plans were on a scale of unlimited
liberality. The streets, each eight rods
in width, were made to cross at right angles,
dividing the city into rectangular blocks, each
of ten acres. The choicest block in point of
situation was designated as the site of the
prospective temple; and is now occupied by
the world-famed Temple, the Tabernacle, and
the less pretentious Assembly Hall. The
original survey was made to include a hundred
and thirty-five of these ten-acre blocks; several
were chosen for public squares and parks; the
remainder were to be divided into city lots for
the accommodation of the thousands soon to
come.</p>

<p>Religious devotion, the inspiring cause of
this seemingly reckless scheme of colonization,
demanded facilities for public worship; and,
lacking chapel, synagogue, or temple, the colonists
provided a leafy tabernacle. Trees were
hauled from the mountains, and of these a
bowery was constructed, which for a time was
church, court-house, and capitol.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span></p>

<p>Having learned by experience that Indian
attacks were to be expected, the settlers congregated
on a single ten-acre block, which
they enclosed by erecting their huts of logs and
adobe along the eastern border. Each hut
opened inward toward the centre of the square
and was provided with a loophole on the
outer side; the space between the houses and
the sides of the block not occupied by habitations
was protected by a continuous wall of
adobe. With the increase of population additions
were made to the fort; but as soon as
the ruddy aborigines learned that the white
invaders were their friends, the fort was abandoned,
and the settlers distributed themselves
over the city area.</p>

<p>At the time of its first settlement Utah was
a part of the Mexican domain; nevertheless,
the "Mormon" colonists, confident as to the
destiny of their nation, patriotically raised
the Stars and Stripes and took possession of the
region in the name of the United States. A
prominent hill, part of the Wasatch spur which
bounds the present city on the northeast like
a fortress wall, was chosen as the flag site;
and this elevation is to-day known as Ensign
Peak. From its summit, now surmounted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
an enduring flag-staff of steel, the banner of
freedom is thrown to the mountain breezes on
public holidays and other occasions of patriotic
celebration.</p>

<p>More colonists arrived in parties great and
small; and by the spring of 1848 approximately
seventeen hundred souls were encamped
in the valley, more than four hundred
dwellings had been erected within the confines
of the old fort, and about five thousand
acres of land had been brought under cultivation.
In May and June, the settlers were arrayed
in battle order, not against human foes
but to fight the dreaded insect scourge, the
Rocky Mountain crickets, which in countless
hordes descended from the mountains and invaded
the fields and gardens. Every member
of the little community, man, woman, or child,
was called into action but to little purpose.
When the people had been reduced to despair
they were saved by what they devoutly believed
to be a special and miraculous interposition
of Providence. There suddenly
appeared on the western horizon a tremulous
cloud which grew in magnitude as it rapidly
approached, until at last it was seen to be the
vanguard of an advancing army of gulls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
Down swooped the white-winged deliverers,
devouring the crickets with incredible voracity
until but few were left alive. Since that day the
gulls have been sacred in Utah. Every spring
they come to follow the plough as it turns the
soil for the season's seed, and so confident are
they of their safety that they may be approached
almost within arm's length. Added
to the ruin wrought by the crickets was a
further deprivation, due to drought and frosts.
The harvest of 1848 was little better than a
failure, and the succeeding winter and spring
were seasons of extreme destitution. The
people were brought to the dire necessity of
gathering the wild weeds of the desert and
even of boiling the raw hides in their camps
for sustenance. The bulbous roots of the
sego lily&mdash;now the banner-flower of the State&mdash;were
dug for food; but the pangs of hunger
were an experience from which none escaped.
However, the following season brought a more
abundant return from the soil and the prospects
of the colony brightened.</p>

<p>In February, 1848, the treaty of Guadaloupe
Hidalgo secured by cession from Mexico to
the United States the region now embraced
by Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
California. The great republic reached the
Pacific, and Salt Lake City became an integral
part of the United States. Up to this time,
and, indeed, for a year thereafter, the governmental
affairs of the new community were
administered almost wholly by the Church
authorities. In February, 1849, the city was
divided into nineteen ecclesiastical wards, over
each of which a "bishopric" presided, consisting
of a bishop and his two counsellors, who combined
with their purely churchly function the
duties of magistrates and civil officers. They
regulated the levying and disbursing of taxes,
the construction of roads and bridges, and the
like.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<span class="caption">JEDEDIAH M. GRANT, FIRST MAYOR
OF SALT LAKE CITY.</span>
</div>

<p>In the early months of 1849 steps were taken
toward the establishment of a State government
from which the city might hope to derive
corporate powers. It was proposed that the
State of which Salt Lake City was destined to
be the capital be called Deseret&mdash;a name occurring
in the records of the ancient inhabitants
of the continent, as set forth in the Book of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
Mormon, and meaning "the honey bee." The
hive, expressive of the characteristic industry
and thrift of the people, was chosen as the
symbol and seal of the prospective State.
Pending action by the national Congress, the
"Provisional
Government
of the State of
Deseret" was
established,
and its officers
were duly elected.
The General
Assembly
of the State of
Deseret, in
January, 1851,
chartered
"Great Salt
Lake City"
and appointed
its first Mayor, Jedediah M. Grant, and other
municipal officers. The people were not yet
informed that four months before, September
9, 1850, the Congress of the United States
had refused their petition for statehood and
had created the Territory of Utah. The acts<span class="pagenum">[492]</span>
of the provisional government were subsequently
confirmed by the first territorial Legislature,
and the city's charter was thus legalized.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_534.jpg"> EAGLE GATE.</a><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492"></a></div>

<p>Each passing year added to the attractiveness
of the new capital. An orchard had been
planted on every unoccupied lot, shade trees
were placed along the outer borders of the
sidewalks, and to nourish these a small stream
was made to flow down either side of every
street. The city became the acknowledged
business centre of the inter-mountain region.
Situated on the road to the gold regions, when
the gold fever was at its height, travel was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
heavy, and the settlers found a ready market
for anything they could produce from the soil.
Gold-seekers hastening westward and successful
miners returning eastward halted at
this oasis to replenish their supplies, and left
their wealth in lavish abundance to enrich the
people of the desert, who, however, had little
need of gold in their local trade, and valued it
only for the implements of husbandry and
building it would buy in the East. A strange
spectacle was presented of a city destitute of
many necessaries and of most of the luxuries
of life, yet rich to affluence in gold, which was
sent back to "the States" by the bucketful.</p>

<p>Merchandise was brought in by fleets of
"prairie schooners," and the contents of each
of these wheeled boats of mountain and plain
were eagerly bought up. There was danger
of class distinctions arising, of the few who had
most gold to spare buying more than their
share, and so becoming rich at the expense
of their fellows. Acting on the counsel of
their President, the people adopted rules to
secure an equable distribution of imported
goods. Later the settlers established their
merchandise business on a plan of co-operation,
and Zion's Co-operative Mercantile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
Institution began its phenomenally successful
career. The chief establishment of this system
is still operating, with headquarters in Salt
Lake City, and its annual sales, officially attested,
average over four million dollars.</p>

<p>The city's very existence was threatened in
1857. A detachment of the United States
army numbering over two thousand men was
ordered to Utah by President Buchanan for
the purpose of suppressing an alleged insurrection,
which, it was reported, had culminated
in the destruction of the court records and the
driving of the federal judge, Drummond, from
his bench. When news of the libellous charges
against the people reached Utah, the clerk of
Judge Drummond's own court issued a full denial
under official seal. But the mischievous
misrepresentation had already produced its
effect at the nation's capital, and the army was
on the march.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_537.jpg"> BRIGHAM YOUNG MONUMENT.</a><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495"></a></div>

<p>Mail contractors operating between the Missouri
River and Salt Lake City brought word
of the approaching soldiery, and reported
threats of both officers and men as to the summary
way in which they would dispose of the
people when once they found themselves within
the "City of the Saints." The Latter-day Saints
understood the intensity of the public sentiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
against them; they felt, too, the injustice
of the libel. They believed that the army's
invasion of their city and Territory meant their
massacre. Brigham Young was still Governor
of Utah, and the territorial militia was subject
to his command. He promptly proclaimed
martial law throughout the Territory, and forbade
any armed forces to enter its confines.
Echo Cañon, the easiest avenue of approach,
was fortified. In its defiles an army might
well be stopped by a few. The people had
been roused to desperation. Force was to be
met with force.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_539.jpg"> MAIN STREET IN 1861.</a><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497"></a></div>

<p>The army wintered at Fort Bridger, Wyoming,
amid severe vicissitudes. In the meantime
a full report of the situation had been
made by Governor Young to the President of
the United States. President Buchanan tacitly
admitted his rashness, but to recall the troops
at that juncture would be to openly confess the
blunder. A peace commissioner, in the person
of Colonel Thomas B. Kane, was dispatched to
Salt Lake City, and finally the President's appointees
were conducted through the "Mormon"
lines by "Mormon" militia, and were
duly inducted into office. Then it was demonstrated
that the court records were intact, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
the people at peace. The army followed later,
under pledge that its ranks be not broken
within the city limits and that its camp be not
within forty miles of the capital. And when
at last the soldiers threaded the streets, a
strange sight met their view. Salt Lake City
was deserted, except for a few men who stood
with lighted torches in hand ready to fire the
heaps of combustibles that had been piled in
every house. For the people, loth to trust too
implicitly in the unwilling promises of officers
smarting under the consciousness of defeat,
had abandoned their homes, with the solemn
determination that if the invaders made a
single attempt at plunder they should find
naught but ashes for their loot.</p>

<p>But the promises were kept in good faith.
The army established its headquarters at Camp
Floyd, forty miles southwest from the city.
There the soldiers remained until summoned
back, at the outbreak of the Civil War. During
their two years' encampment in Utah, the
soldiers were fed by the people. Everything
in the nature of food was eagerly bought up
at an unusual price, and thus the nation's gold
found its way into the hands of the citizens.<span class="pagenum">[499]</span>
Then, so great was the hurry of the army's
departure, so urgent the need of speedy travel,
that all their belongings outside of actual
necessities were sold for a trifle or given away.
The reason why the people regard the coming
of "Buchanan's army" as a blessing to their
city is evident.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_541.jpg"> HOUSE BUILT IN 1847 WITHIN THE OLD FORT.</a><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499"></a></div>


<p>In 1861 the Overland Telegraph Line, which
had been approaching the city from both east
and west, was completed, and Salt Lake City
was relieved of some of the disadvantages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
its desert isolation. Eight years later the
Union Pacific and the Central Pacific railways
reached Utah, and from that time to the
present the development of both city and State
has been of phenomenal rapidity.</p>

<p>From the earliest period of its existence
Salt Lake City has been strong and untiring
in its efforts to secure adequate educational
facilities. In October, 1847, only three months
after the pioneer entry, a school was opened
within the walls of the Old Fort. The schoolhouse
was a tent, and for seats and desks
hewn slabs and sections of logs were brought
into service. Other schools followed and the
people thus early voiced their desire for secondary
and higher instruction. In February,
1850, when the city was less than three years
old, "The University of the State of Deseret"
with its seat at "Great Salt Lake City" was
incorporated by the legislative assembly of the
provisional government. In November of
that year the "University" began its work in
the field of secondary instruction under the
name of "The Parent School." As suggested
by this title branch schools were conducted
in the smaller settlements. The institution
thus grandly projected in the face of seemingly
insurmountable obstacles has grown with
the commonwealth, and to-day, under the name
of the University of Utah, compares favorably
with other State colleges of the West. The
present public-school system is the pride of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
the city. Stately school buildings, modern
and efficient, and the best equipment procurable
are provided; and the schools are free.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_543.jpg"> MORMON TEMPLE.</a><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501"></a></div>

<p>And so the city has grown, gathering
strength with its years, but in surprising proportion.
It has ever been quick to adopt
the conveniences of advancing civilization;
for there was little of the old to sweep away.
Its street-cars are driven by the power of
the mountain cataract thirty-five miles away.
Its streets, public buildings, and dwellings are
lighted by the same mysterious force, and its
factories and industrial establishments are
electrically operated. In few cities indeed is
the electric energy more generally utilized.</p>

<p>Among its notable structures a few demand
special mention. First in popular interest,
perhaps first also in historic significance, is
the great "Mormon" Temple, constructed
throughout of solid granite from the eruptive
exposures of the Wasatch. The corner-stone
was laid April 6, 1853, and the completed
Temple was dedicated April 6, 1893. During
the four decades occupied in the work over
three and a half millions of dollars were expended
on the structure. Let it be remembered
that the building was begun amid most<span class="pagenum">[503]</span>
meagre facilities for such an undertaking&mdash;when
the services of several yoke of oxen
were required for the bringing of a single
block of granite from the famed Cottonwood
Cañon a score of miles south of the city.
Of the four temples already erected in the
vales of Utah, the one at Salt Lake City was
the first to be commenced and the last to be
finished.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_545.jpg"> MORMON TABERNACLE.</a><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503"></a></div>

<p>The domed roof of the Tabernacle has attracted
the attention of every one who has
seen even a picture of the city. In some of
its architectural features the building is unique.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
It covers an area of 250 x 180 feet and has a
seating capacity of eight thousand. The colossal
roof-arch springs from wall to wall without
a supporting pillar. Within is the monster
organ, which for size and scope is approached
by few instruments in the world. It was constructed
in early days from native material by
Utah artisans, and has been regarded as a
marvel of mechanical and artistic achievement.</p>

<p>The story of Salt Lake City is really a
chapter of "Mormon" history. To-day its
population would probably show a majority
of non-Mormons, but the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints is the dominant
sect in city and State. Numerous other
churches have established themselves; many
of them have reared imposing sanctuaries
and are active in the promulgation of their
doctrines.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_547.jpg"> CITY AND COUNTY BUILDING, SALT LAKE CITY.</a><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505"></a></div>

<p>Non-Mormon citizens have been as ready
and earnest in their efforts to build up and
sustain the city of their choice as have their
Latter-day Saint fellows; and the present
beauty, strength, and vitality of the intermountain
metropolis are largely due to non-Mormon,
or "Gentile," enterprise and energy.
The "Gentiles" have ever been the more
prominent in mining undertakings, and the<span class="pagenum">[506]</span>
large and paying mines of to-day are mostly
theirs. Salt Lake City does not belong to
the "Mormons"; it is the possession of its
citizens without regard to religious profession
or political preference.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_548.jpg"> LION AND BEE-HIVE HOUSES.</a><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506"></a></div>

<p>Since man and nature combined their energies
in this once desert spot, the favored
situation, the many natural advantages have
yearly grown more apparent. Located at the
very base of the Wasatch, bounded in part
by a spur of this majestic range, the city possesses
a wealth of mountain scenery beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
description. The valley floor is part of the
bed of an inland sea of Quaternary age; and
the benches and hills constituting the choicest
residence portions are the terraces of this
ancient lake, or the deltas of the prehistoric
streams whose mouths were at the present
cañon openings. Capitol Hill and the Northeast
Bench are parts of the great delta constructed
by City Creek in Lake Bonneville.
Of this Pleistocene water body, approximately
equal to Lake Huron in extent, the present
Salt Lake, in spite of its common appellation
"great," is but a diminutive fragment.</p>

<p>The present population as attested by the
recent census returns is 53,531; though the
current city directory, compiled immediately
after the census enumeration, gives names
and addresses of nearly seventy thousand resident
inhabitants. The city's growing importance
as a manufacturing, commercial, railroad,
and mining centre is generally recognized:
while its enterprise, progressiveness, and wealth
are of national repute. But beyond all such
it is to be characterized as a city of homes.
From cottage to mansion its residences are
very generally owned by their tenants. Its
citizens are, for the most part, permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
residents and the city is theirs. Its increase
has been that of development rather than of
growth; the distinction is a vital one, for it
characterizes the expansion of the living organism
as against mere accretion of substance.</p>

<p>With such a development in the course
of less than five and a half decades, what shall
be its condition and status when its years
have linked themselves into centuries?</p>

perilous trails through the wilderness of the
far Northwest but their picturesque adventures
gave no hint of the city of wealth, industry,
and architectural beauty that was to rise on
both banks of the Spokane cataract. Though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
Jefferson's renowned secretary, Meriwether
Lewis, and his comrade Clark, brother of
George Rogers Clark, heralded the day when
the Oregon and its affluents should hear
sounds more significant than their own dashings,
their pilgrimage had become as dim
as a tradition to the men of the present
generation who first floated C&oelig;ur d'Alene
tamarack and cedar down the swift Spokane
to their sawmill at the falls.</p>

<p>On the Spokane River not far from its confluence
with the Columbia the Northwest Fur
Company built a post more than ninety years
ago, and thence reckless <i>voyageurs</i> found their
way through the solitudes, pausing to trade at
the villages of the Spokanes, the Flatheads,
the Umatillas, the Walla Wallas, the Nez
Percés, and others, taking red women cheerfully
in marriage and as cheerfully deserting
them when occasion called. In this remote
frontier, beyond the utmost reach of ethics or
law, in a region with a cloud upon its national
title, the pioneers fulfilled their semi-savage
destiny. Nelson Durham, a writer of Spokane,
has patriotically designated the Spokane
Plains as the site of the annual horse-racing
and saturnalia of these skin-clad trappers and
traders, but they left no landmarks and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
noise of their revelry had long since died
away when the first Anglo-Saxon, lured by the
roar of the falls, came to harness those tumultuous
waters to his wheel.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_553.jpg"> THE COUNTY COURT HOUSE, SPOKANE.</a><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511"></a></div>

<p>There is a tradition that the Spokane Indians
shunned this now famed succession of wild
cascades, for in the foaming maelstrom at the
foot of the falls dwelt a malign goddess, her
long hair streaming in the cataract, her shimmering
figure half revealed in the enveloping
mists of spray. While the waters danced
about her she sang merrily and the sound of
her singing was like the warbling of a thousand
birds. With her outstretched arms she
lured Indian fishermen and devoured them.
Her flowing hair was a trammel that enmeshed
her victims. None had ever returned. Shaman
after shaman, under his totem pole, had unavailingly
invoked his tomañowash incantations
to destroy her power. Then Speelyai
or Coyote, the great Indian god, transforming
himself into a feather, floated over the falls
and was speedily engulfed by the evil goddess.
Assuming the form of a strong warrior he began
his campaign. Around him were the
wrecks of skin and bark canoes, the forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
unnumbered members of his tribes, and a bedraggled
eagle which proved to be Whaiama,
god of the upper air. With a stone axe
Speelyai hewed his way through the monster's
side and Whaiama bore the resurrected company
to the high banks of the Spokane River.
Now Speelyai pronounced a curse upon his
groaning enemy. Her career as a destroyer
was at an end. Henceforth she might entice
some helpless wanderers from distant tribes,
but the chosen ones she should destroy no
more. And the god prophesied in conclusion
that a better race would come some day, a
strange people, whom she could not conquer,
and who would bind and enslave her forever.</p>

<p>These falls, whose total volume equals the
power of forty thousand horses, turn the
wheels of factories the value of whose exports
to China, Japan, and other lands is
expressed in millions. The waterpower
speeds electric street-cars over ninety miles
of track, and conducts electricity through two
hundred and fifty miles of arc mains. All
the elevators and printing-presses of the city
are operated by power from the falls, and to
this all-supplying current are attached many
sewing-machines, typewriters, phonographs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
graphophones, churns, electric fans, music boxes,
door-bells, burglar alarms, clocks, and
hundreds of other contrivances calling for
constant or occasional motive power. Spokane
is credited with being the most modern
and best-equipped city in the world, and this
is due, first, to the falls whose power brings
many utilities, considered luxuries in other
communities, within reach of the lowliest
consumer; and secondly, to the singular fact
that the city is newer than the telephone, the
electric light, and other latter-day inventions
and discoveries. There were no ancient
institutions and prejudices to supplant. To
children reared in Spokane, other cities seem
archaic, their streets sloven, and their homes
grotesquely behind the times. A girl from
Spokane visiting in New York is known to
have written home about the bizarre appearance
of "electric cars drawn by horses."</p>

<p>London gropes by night through dismal
glimmerings of gas and it would require millions
of reluctant pounds sterling to substitute
more modern light. In the new city of Spokane
it was the most natural procedure to
<ins class="corr" title='Correction: Text was "instal"'>install</ins> the latest conveniences of modern life.
When the little settlement was but a cluster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
of ambitious cabins every abode had its telephone
and its electric lights. The Spokane
workman does not stumble up the steps of a
dim tenement. Lumber is cheap and in variety,
and even Spokane granite is within his
means. He dwells in a good home. A click
of a button at the door floods the dwelling
with light. Sputtering wicks have no place
in his economy. He can afford, too, to order
his groceries by telephone or use the same
medium to discuss politics with a friend in a
distant part of the city. All members of polite
society in Spokane have telephones. A
lady planning an impromptu tea or lawn party
gets out her calling list, reaches for the telephone,
and issues her amiable summons. A
great amount of local business is transacted
over the wires in the city. The power of the
falls likewise enables the telephones of Spokane
to talk and trade with a thousand towns,
the distant city of San Francisco coming
within the Spokane circuit.</p>

<p>Thus, in the employment of waterpower to
serve the city in manifold ways, the Indians
say, has been fulfilled the prophecy of Speelyai
that a race would come which should yoke the
goddess of the cataract in perpetual servitude.<span class="pagenum">[516]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_558.jpg"> THE LAST CHIEF TO INTIMIDATE THE INHABITANTS OF SPOKANE.</a><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516"></a></div>

<p>In further fulfilment of the prediction that
the demoniacal siren of the falls should no
longer have dominion over his people, the
Spokanes and kindred tribes shunned the river,
and from a race of fishers, paddling bent and
kneeling in their crude canoes, they became
an intrepid race of horsemen. On horseback
they rode to war or hunted the moose and
antelope, and horses became the sign of wealth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
and the medium of exchange. For their
obedience in carrying out the details of his
malediction upon the water demon, Speelyai
prospered them. Their wealth increased and
their numbers multiplied. Their tepees were
warm with many furs and picturesque with
the trophies of battle and the chase. Their
larders abounded with dried meat, meal, wapatoo,
and camas root. They became the most
valiant warriors between the Bitter Root
Mountains and the sea. The power of the
allied tribes of Eastern Washington became
so formidable that the American Government
was compelled to send its most skilful military
leaders to effect their pacification, and it was
not until Phil Sheridan eclipsed them in daring
and General Miles forced Chief Joseph to
capitulation that the scattered settlers in the
Spokane country ceased to tremble at the
impending descent of mounted savages.</p>

<p>By repeated violation of treaty stipulations,
by burnings and massacres and thefts, they
had asserted their dominion. In 1858 the
Spokanes gave tragic demonstration of their
determination to enforce the native declaration
that the armies of the whites should
never traverse their domain. In that year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
Colonel Steptoe, seeking to lead a detachment
to garrison the post of the Hudson Bay
Company at Colville, near the British border,
was defeated with great slaughter by the
Spokanes. With an unscalped remnant of
his force he crawled at night from the scene
of his disaster and, abandoning his guns,
rushed in confusion back to Walla Walla.
The god of Indian battles still reigned and
the Government at Washington was alarmed.
Then Colonel George Wright was chosen to
command, a man whose merciless determination
and sanguinary triumphs gave to his
notable campaign a distinction not paralleled
until the Sirdar of Egypt just forty years
later led his expedition to Khartoum, silenced
the dervishes near Omdurman, and hurled the
severed head of the Khalifa into the Nile. The
Spokanes did not attribute their defeat to
the superior strategy of their pale-faced foe.
Their fatal mistake, they said, was in making
their last stand on the Spokane Plains, within
sound of the exultant shrieking and sinister
roaring of their ancient enemy, the evil spirit
of the Spokane cataract, and it was she, not
their white conqueror, who herded and stampeded
them into terrified surrender. They
had fought with abandoned daring, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
employed all their arts of strategy, but were
forced back toward the abode of the water
monster until her roaring mockery thundered
in their ears. Now they set the tall prairie
grass afire, and over the site of the coming
city there blazed on that parched day of
September 5, 1858, a conflagration no less
formidable than war. It enveloped, but could
not stay the pursuing column. Destiny was
striding through flame and blood that day
to open a way for civilized occupation of the
Pacific Northwest. Hundreds of painted
warriors, including the leader of the Palouses,
a chief of the Pend d'Oreilles, one of
the chiefs of the C&oelig;ur d'Alenes, and two
brothers of Spokane Gary, the commander of
the savage army, lay dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_561.jpg"> THE CITY HALL, SPOKANE.</a><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519"></a></div>

<p>As if by a miracle, not one of Colonel
Wright's soldiers fell, a further proof to the
Indians that their evil goddess had presided
over the conflict. In token of their subjection
they brought their wives, children, horses,
and all portable belongings and made complete
offering at the feet of their conqueror. Thus
the site of the present city of Spokane became
the scene of one of the most striking and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
significant triumphs of civilized man over the
aborigines of the American continent. What
William Henry Harrison did at Tippecanoe
for the old Northwest in scattering the allied
natives under Tecumseh, Colonel Wright accomplished
at Spokane Plains for the Northwest
in demolishing the league of tribes under
the Spokanes. It is true that Chief Joseph
later, emulating the ambitions of Black Hawk,
sought to reunite the tribes in rebellion against
the whites, but though he succeeded in stirring
the Federal Government to vigilant campaigns,
he failed in his great object, just as
did the successor of Tecumseh. Wright's
sway was undisputed. Indians convicted of
crimes he ordered hanged. Superfluous horses
were shot. He spread terror as he moved,
and peace followed in his footsteps.</p>

<p>But the Civil War and financial panic delayed
the Western movement. In 1863 there
were but ninety registered citizens in the Spokane
country. And when the first sawmill
came, in 1873, its wheels revolved slowly, for
the failure of Jay Cooke delayed the transcontinental
railway, that was to connect the city
with the East. Eight years later, just twenty
years ago, the first locomotive rumbled into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
the new settlement. Now there was to be a
city. On September 1st of that year came the
first lawyer, J. Kennedy Stout, and it is characteristic
of the spirit that has ever continued
to quicken the activities of the community that
four days after
his arrival he
had drafted a
charter for the
city, taken the
necessary legal
steps toward its
incorporation,
and had been
chosen its attorney.</p>

<span class="caption">J. KENNEDY STOUT.</span>
</div>

<p>In 1885, the
city, numbering
two thousand
people, was an alert and distributing centre.
Grain was pouring in from the fertile acres of
the Palouse to be ground into flour, and the
time was at hand when a remarkable discovery
in the neighboring mountains of Idaho was to
turn the tide of travel toward Spokane, and in
less than a decade develop it into the greatest
railroad centre west of Chicago. It was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
that year that three men and an ass, in the
C&oelig;ur d'Alenes, a few miles from Spokane,
camped toward night in a desolate cañon.
Their provisions were nearly exhausted. They
held forlorn council, and decided to abandon
their search for mines in those gloomy and
precipitous solitudes. Toward sundown the
animal strayed from its tether. They found
it gazing across the ravine at a reflected gleam
of the setting sun. A marvellous series of ore
seams had mirrored the light. The dumb
beast had discovered the greatest deposits of
galena on the globe. The whole mountain
was a mine.</p>

<p>Within an hour after the arrival of the sensational
news at Spokane, that city's unparalleled
boom began. Prospectors, engineers,
and capitalists from the four corners of the
Republic hurried to the new city. A railway
magnate rode out on horseback to view the
mountain, and within four months from the
day of his visit ore was being shipped by rail
to Spokane. North and south, for three
hundred miles, mines were found on every
mountainside, and every additional discovery
hastened Spokane's growth and quickened the
fever of its speculation. As a local historian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
said, "Men went to sleep at night on straw
mattresses, and woke to find themselves on
velvet couches stuffed with greenbacks."
Wealth waited for men at every corner. The
delirium of speculation whirled the sanest
minds. Of the many clergymen, for example,
who arrived to advocate the perfecting of
titles to homes not made with hands, eleven
abdicated the pulpit and, indifferent to the
menace of moth and rust, laid up substantial
treasure.</p>

<p>Five years from the discovery of the mines
in the C&oelig;ur d'Alenes the city numbered
twenty thousand inhabitants. Fire swept over
it and laid twenty-two solid squares in ashes.
Before the ruins cooled, the city was being rebuilt,
this time in steel and brick and stone.
The <i>Spokesman-Review</i>, which began its editorial
career in a small, discarded chapel, soon
moved into a ten-story structure, and that evolution
was, in epitome, the story of the city.
Architects of some renown designed palaces
and châteaux for the wealthy. Every citizen
hoped to outdazzle his neighbor in the beauty
of his home, and this has resulted in giving
Spokane unique distinction in architectural
impressiveness.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_567.jpg"> THE "SPOKESMAN-REVIEW" BUILDING.</a><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525"></a></div>

<p>Though Spokane has had abundant share<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
of that rampant Western virility, the story of
whose unrestraint would constitute a daring
contribution to profane history, the city from
the start displayed a dominating purpose that
made for civic righteousness. It is true that
during its earlier years there were many murders
in Spokane, for citizens, in the midst of
its hurrying events, were impatient of prolix
complaints and the tardy judgments of the
law. Nor did this reckless code much concern
the hangman, for the legal execution of a
citizen in Spokane would have been regarded
much as the world would now look upon the
shuddering crime of burning a Christian at
the stake; yet in its blood-shedding there was
little, if any, of the wanton element of anarchy,
and upon few occasions in the history
of the Northwest has crime stooped to assassinate
from ambush. Outwardly calm, but
with desperation in his mood, the insulted approached
the object of his wrath and warned
him to "heel" himself. Inevitable shooting
marked their next meeting, and their funerals
were not infrequently held simultaneously.</p>

<p>The bad man of melodrama is an execrable
creation of fiction, whose counterpart was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
long tolerated in Spokane's career, and who
does not seem to have made his presence felt
in other sections of the West. A desperado
of the early days sent word from a neighboring
town that, because of some dispute, he
would kill a certain Spokane citizen on sight.
The community could not afford to lose an
influential pioneer, and the city fathers met
to consider the outlaw's menace. They decided
that, inasmuch as they would be called
upon to execute him ultimately, they would
better hang him before he had opportunity to
pull his criminal trigger, and to this programme
they pledged their official honor and
forwarded notice of their grim deliberation to
the desperado, who thereupon deemed it expedient
to strike the Lolo trail that led to less
discriminating frontiers. Spokane has outlived
its lawless days. For several years it
enjoyed the police protection of a noted bandit-catcher,
whose nerve was unfailing and
whose aim was sure. The ensuing hegira of
criminal classes was a spectacle for other cities
to contemplate with awe. During his stern
<i>régime</i>, a riotous stranger, mistaking the temper
of the community, flourished weapons and
for a few agonizing moments made pedestrians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
his targets. The clamor brought the cool chief
of police. "Did you subdue the stranger?"
he was afterward asked. "We buried him the
next day," was the reply.</p>

<p>In the few years that have ensued since the
country's occupation by the whites, the once
masterful Spokane tribe has degenerated, the
Indians around Spokane to-day shambling
about under the generic epithet of "siwash";
and a writer visiting this region in recent
days came to the etymological conclusion that
the first syllable in their unhappy title stood
for "never."</p>

<p>Though Spokane is famous, its precise locality
is not generally known. When it became
ambitious and first held expositions, it
ordered lithographic posters from Chicago.
They came representing steamboats plying
placidly in a river whose falls are as deadly as
Niagara's. Spokane is twenty-four hours'
ride from the cities of Puget Sound. It is
three days' journey from San Francisco, and
to go from Spokane to Helena or Butte is
like travelling from Chicago to Denver. Its
future must be great. It has no rival. Eight
railroads, three of them transcontinental, assert
its supremacy. Southward stretches the
most prolific grain empire in the world. Almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
boundless forests of valuable timber
cover surrounding mountains to the north
and east, whose mineral wealth is beyond
compute.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_571.jpg"> MIDDLE FALLS, SPOKANE.</a><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529"></a></div>

<p>A typical Westerner, in an interesting autobiography,
states that the ass that discovered
the mines of the C&oelig;ur d'Alene, and thus
caused a stampede of civilization to Spokane,
was buried with the ceremonial honors due
a potentate. It takes conspicuous place in
distinguished company. On the heights of
Peor an altar was reared to canonize the ass
that saw the Light the prophet Balaam all
but passed. An ass by its braying wrought
the salvation of Vesta, and the animal's coronation
was an event in the festival of that goddess.
For ages the Procession of the Ass
was a solemn rite in religious observances.
In Spokane, a favorite canvas pictures the
C&oelig;ur d'Alene immortal gazing enraptured
across a mountain chasm at shining ledges of
galena. When explaining the various causes
of the matchless development of Spokane and
its tributary region, the resident, in merry
mood, does not forget to pilot the visitor to
this quaint memorial. Afterward there was
litigation over the mineral wealth now valued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
at $4,000,000 located by this animal, the outcome
of which was the following decision
handed down by Judge Norman Buck of the
District Court of Idaho:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_573.jpg"> MIDDLE FALLS, ECHO FLOUR MILLS, AND OLD POWER HOUSE.</a><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531"></a></div>

<blockquote><p>"From the evidence of the witnesses, this Court is
of the opinion that the Bunker Hill mine was discovered
by the jackass, Phil O'Rourke, and N.S. Kellogg;
and as the jackass is the property of the plaintiffs,
Cooper &amp; Peck, they are entitled to a half interest in
the Bunker Hill, and a quarter interest in the Sullivan
claims."</p></blockquote>

<p>Spokane has a rare climate of cloudless days.
The Indians say that once it shared the fogs
and copious rains of the seacoast, but that
their tutelary god, ascending to the heavens,
slew the Thunderer, and that thenceforth they
dwelt under radiant skies, and were called
Spokanes, or Sons of the Sun.</p>

<p>A college of artists could not have devised
a more beautiful location for a city. It is set
in a gigantic amphitheatre two thousand feet
above sea level. High walls of basalt, picturesque
with spruce and cedar and pine, form
the city's rim. Against this background have
been built mansions that would adorn Fifth
Avenue or the Circles of the national capital.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
Forming the city's southern border winds an
abysmal gorge, and along its brink has been
built one of the city's fashionable boulevards.
The cataracts of the Spokane some day must
inspire poets. In some parts of the city,
affording adornments for numberless gardens,
are volcanic, pyramidal rocks. The Indians
say that these columns are the petrified forms
of amazons who, issuing from the woods, were
about to plunge into the river for a bath, ignorant
of the water demon, when Speelyai to
save them turned them into stone.</p>

<p>It is significant of the lure of Spokane that
men who have accumulated millions and sold
their mines still make it their place of permanent
residence. Though the city as it is to-day
has been built in the dozen years that
have elapsed since its great fire, there is no
hint of hasty development within its boundaries.
Singular fertility in its soil has so
fostered its shade trees and its gardens that
a sense is conveyed of years of affluent ease
and attention to æsthetic detail. Spokane is
in many respects the most consummate embodiment
on the continent of that typical
American genius that has redeemed the wilderness
of the frontier.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span></p>

<h2>PORTLAND<br />

THE METROPOLIS OF THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST</h2>

<p class="cen">"Where rolls the Oregon."&mdash;<i>Bryant</i>.</p>

<p class="chapby">By THOMAS L. COLE</p>


<p class="noin"><span class="first">O</span>NE autumn evening in 1843, A.M. Overton
and A.L. Lovejoy, two residents of
Oregon City, on their way home from Vancouver,
landed from their canoe and pitched
their tent for the night under the pine trees
upon the west bank of the Willamette River.
Before they resumed their journey, the next
day, they had projected a town upon the site
of their encampment. Within a few months,
a clearing was made and a log cabin built.
From this beginning grew the present city of
Portland.</p>

<p>But our story must go back of this beginning,
for the historical significance of Portland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
lies not so much in the fact that it is to-day
the great metropolis of that vast territory,
once all called Oregon, and now divided into
the States of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and
parts of Wyoming and Montana, not to mention
British Columbia; but its significance is
rather to be sought in the consideration that
in Portland culminated and found final form
the metropolitan life of Oregon Territory,
which, in its earlier and richer historical period,
found expression successively in Astoria,
Vancouver, and Oregon City. Thus, for the
essential beginning of the history of the metropolis
of the Pacific Northwest, we must go
back to the embryo metropolis established by
Astor at the mouth of the Columbia River.
This point of departure, while relatively
remote, yet carries us back over less than a
century of time.</p>

<p>Nearly two hundred years had passed after
Henry Hudson sailed the <i>Half-Moon</i> up the
North River before the waters of the mighty
Oregon were disturbed by any craft save
the Indian's canoe. Beyond suspicions and
reports of Indians, the great "River of the
West" was unknown, and that vast territory
beyond the Rocky Mountains which it drains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
was undiscovered until April 29, 1792, when
Captain Gray, commanding the <i>Columbia
Rediviva</i>, from Boston, crossed its bar and
landed upon its bank, to the consternation of
the Indians, who now saw a white face for the
first time. Gray
named the river
after his vessel,
the Columbia,
and took possession
of the country
in the name
of the United
States. A few
months later,
Broughton, a
lieutenant of the
explorer Vancouver,
to whose
incredulous ears
Gray had communicated his discovery, entered
the Columbia, and in turn claimed everything
in the name of King George. These
conflicting claims furnish a key to the critical
period in the history of the Columbia River
territory. For a long time neither America
nor Great Britain forced a determination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
of its claim, and a succession of treaties gave
to the citizens of both countries equal rights
in the territory. Each government, however,
encouraged its citizens to make good
the national claim by actual possession. The
first attraction to Oregon Territory was that
which led Captain Gray, with other expeditions,
to the coast, viz., the abundance of fur-bearing
animals. The first British occupation
was that of the Northwest Fur Company of
Canada, which pushed some posts across the
Rockies to the far north. The way for American
occupation was opened when the successful
explorations of the Lewis and Clark expedition,
which camped over the winter of
1805 at the mouth of the Columbia, demonstrated
the practicability of an overland route
to Oregon. Into this opening John Jacob
Astor promptly entered. As the "American
Fur Company," Astor had successfully checked
the aggressions of the powerful Canadian
companies in the northern United States. He
now projected a scheme, under the name of
the "Pacific Fur Company," whereby to
check the movements of these same companies
beyond the Rocky Mountains, and to
possess the new country for the United States.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
The heart of his plan and purpose was a settlement
at the mouth of the Columbia River.
Says Washington Irving, to whose fascinating
book, <i>Astoria</i>, the reader must go for the
story of this magnificent, if ill-starred, enterprise:</p>

<blockquote><p>"He considered his projected establishment at the
mouth of the Columbia as the emporium to an immense
commerce, as a colony that would form the germ of a
wide civilization, that would, in fact, carry the American
population across the Rocky Mountains and spread
it along the shores of the Pacific."</p></blockquote>

<p>Jefferson, who had sent out the Lewis and
Clark expedition, heartily endorsed this project,
as did also his Cabinet. In prosecution
of Astor's purpose, on April 12, 1811, the
<i>Tonquin</i>, the precursor of an intended "annual
vessel," bringing partners, clerks, <i>voyageurs</i>,
and artisans, as well as material and
merchandise, crossed the bar of the Columbia
and cast anchor. Point George, as it
had been named by Broughton, was selected
as a site for the embryo metropolis, and was
renamed Astoria, after the great commoner
whose enterprise it represented. Here, after
the <i>Tonquin</i> had sailed away to its tragic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
fate, the little colony proceeded to establish
itself. A fort, a stone mansion, and
other buildings were erected, and a schooner,
the <i>Dolly</i>, was constructed and launched.
The colonists did some trading with the
neighboring Indians but delayed to reach out
into the surrounding country until the arrival
of Wilson Price Hunt, who was bringing an
expedition overland and was to establish suitable
trading posts <i>en route</i>. Hunt, who was
an American and the chief partner under Mr.
Astor, was to be in charge at Astoria. While
engaged in their work of construction, the
colonists were disturbed by rumors that their
rivals, the Northwest Company, had entered
their territory and established a post on the
Spokane River. This rumor was confirmed
when a canoe came down the Columbia flying
the British standard, and a gentleman, stepping
ashore, introduced himself as David
Thompson, an astronomer and a partner of
the Northwest Company. McDougal, who
was temporarily in charge, was, like several
of Astor's partners, a Scotchman, and a former
Northwest employé. This visitor, therefore,
was treated as an honored guest instead of as a
spy, which he really was. However, it was
determined that David Stuart should at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
take a small party and set up a post as a
check to the one on the Spokane, which he
did at Oakinagen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_583.jpg"> ASTORIA IN 1811. BASED ON A PRINT IN GRAY'S "HISTORY OF OREGON."</a><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541"></a></div>

<p>Another interruption was occasioned by the
shocking news of the massacre of the <i>Tonquin's</i>
crew by Indians and the destruction of
the vessel. To grief at the loss of their
friends was added fear of the Indians, who
they now suspected were plotting against
them. However, McDougal's wit served and
saved them. He threatened to uncork the
smallpox, which he professed to hold confined
in a bottle, and so gained the fear of the Indians,
and the title, "The great smallpox
chief."</p>

<p>After a gloomy winter, Astoria was cheered
in the spring by the arrival of Hunt and his
party. These, after a journey the account of
which reads like a romance, through sufferings
of all kinds and over difficulties all but insurmountable,
reached their destination, haggard
and in rags.</p>

<p>The arrival, soon after, of the annual vessel,
the <i>Beaver</i>, with reinforcements and supplies,
cheered them all and made possible the establishment
of interior posts. The <i>Beaver</i> pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>ceeded
to Alaska, in compliance with an
agreement between Astor and the Russian
Fur Company, which had been made with the
consent of both governments; and Hunt went
with her. The absence of Hunt, which was
prolonged by untoward events, proved fatal to
the Astoria enterprise. Just as the partners
from the several posts were bringing to the
rendezvous the first-fruits of what promised
an abundant harvest in the future, McTavish,
another Northwest partner, surprised
Astoria's people with the alarming news that
war had been declared between the two countries,
and that he was expecting a British
armed vessel to set up a Northwest establishment
at the mouth of the river. Without
waiting for the appearance of this vessel, without
any attempt to send their treasure inland,
and although the Astor Company was in a
stronger trading position than its rival, McDougal,
chief factor in Hunt's absence, sold
out to McTavish all Astor's property for one
third its value. Opposition was offered by
some of the partners and the American clerks
were furious, but Hunt's ominous absence
dampened opposition and cleared McDougal's
way. It is significant that McDougal soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
after received a valuable share in the Northwest
Company. Had Astor been there he
would have "defied them all." "Had our place
and our property been fairly captured I should
have preferred it," wrote Mr. Astor to Hunt,
who doubtless shared the spirit of his chief.
Shortly after the sale, a British officer took
formal possession of the country in the name
of his Britannic Majesty, and Astoria became
Fort George. Although the treaty of
Ghent restored the <i>status ante bellum</i>, Oregon
remained for many years in the actual possession
of England, through the occupation
of its chartered companies. Mr. Astor's
desire to reoccupy Astoria received no backing
by the government and so no American
settlement was even attempted until Captain
Wyeth's venture at Fort William in 1832,
which proved futile.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_587.jpg"> FORT VANCOUVER, 1833.</a><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545"></a></div>

<p>This change from American to British possession
was marked by a transfer of the metropolis
from Fort George to Fort Vancouver.
When Dr. John McLoughlin, upon the absorption
of the Northwestern by the Hudson
Bay Company, in 1821, was sent out as "Chief Factor
of the Columbia River Territory," he
declared that the chief post should be as central
as possible to the trade; that after leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
the mouth of the river there is no disadvantage
in going to the head of navigation;
and that a permanent settlement must be surrounded
by an agricultural country. These
considerations which took McLoughlin to
Vancouver are those which to-day determine
the commercial strength of Portland, across
the river from Vancouver. Thus Fort George
sunk to a subordinate position. After the
boundary was determined a new American
town sprung up under the old name Astoria,
where there are large salmon canneries.</p>

<p>Vancouver, with the outlying posts scattered
throughout the territory, was the centre of a
semi-feudal organization, and its life was picturesque
and full of charm.</p>

<p>Within the palisades was the residence of
the Chief Factor ("Governor" by courtesy),
surrounded by those of the other gentlemen
servants of the Company; together with the
stores, offices, and all other important buildings.
Between the fort and the river lay a
clean, neat, and decorous village of about forty
log houses, occupied by the inferior servants
of the Company, who were, for the most part,
French Canadians. Nearly every man, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
the "Governor" down, had an Indian wife;
for no white woman had as yet set foot in
Oregon. One of these servants writes: "They
all had Indian women, never more than one;
old Dr. McLoughlin would hang them if they
had." The farm, blacksmith's shop, and other
productive activities at Vancouver not only
furnished the subordinate posts of the Company,
but provisions were sent to Alaska, exports
were made to the Hawaiian Islands, and
the American settlers were dependent upon
this post for many of their supplies. Not
only was Vancouver the trading centre, it
was also the "heart and brains of Oregon
Territory." The post hospital offered relief
to American settlers as well as to the subordinate
posts. Here was established the first
school in the territory. The services of the
English Church were regularly maintained, and
opportunity was offered to missionaries of all
denominations to hold service. An annual
dispatch kept open communication with the
outside world and brought books and papers
from the centres of civilization.</p>

<p>The central figure and inspiring genius of
Vancouver was Dr. McLoughlin, who was
a striking and remarkable character. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
remoteness of his post, combined with a self-reliant
nature, made him practically independent
of his superior officers in Montreal or
London. He was indeed, absolute monarch
of all the territory west of the Rocky Mountains.
But the "good doctor," though firm in
character, was a benevolent and a beneficent
despot. "Standing over six feet, six inches,
in height, he was of commanding presence,
with courtly, yet affable manners." Red man
and white man alike revered and loved him,
for to each alike he was kind, and at the same
time just. He was the soul of hospitality and
every traveller found at Vancouver a ready
welcome to a seat at the rich but temperate
board in the common dining-hall, and a bed
in the doctor's house. Library, horses, and
boats were all at the visitor's command. This
spirit of hospitality, joined to a freedom from
national prejudice, characterized the attitude
of McLoughlin towards the missionaries and
other American immigrants who ultimately
began to come into the territory. There was
scarcely a party which was not indebted to
him for material assistance in getting started,
as well as for a courteous welcome at the fort.
Some indeed owed their lives to him and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
other officers at Vancouver, and once at least
their prompt help was in marked contrast to
the indifference of the American settlement.
To this service the missionary records bear
constant testimony, and Lieutenant Frémont,
"the pathfinder," says in his report: "I found
many American Emigrants at the Fort. Others
had already crossed the river to their land of
promise&mdash;the Willamette valley."</p>

<p>We must now follow these American immigrants,
for with them the political dominance
is to pass from Great Britain to the United
States, and the metropolis to move from
Vancouver to the Falls of the Willamette.
Curiously enough, McLoughlin in his own
course will typify this transition.</p>

<p>The very first settlers in the Willamette Valley
were servants of the Hudson Bay Company,
who settled there by the advice and with the
assistance of McLoughlin, who from the first
had properly estimated the value of this river
and valley. He himself took possession of the
falls, with the adjacent land, and held them as
a personal claim, "until such time as there
should be established a government which
could give him title." The town which he developed
on this site he called Oregon City.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span></p>

<p>The first American settlers on the Willamette
were the Methodist missionary party,
under Jason Lee, which crossed the plains
in 1834. To these McLoughlin gave material
aid. Of the Canadians, Lee's nephew writes:
"They gave us a very polite and generous
welcome to the best they could set before us."</p>

<p>Lee's mission was to the Indians, but meeting
with great discouragement in this direction,
he turned his attention to the more interesting
task of forming a political state, which
should be American and also Methodist. The
missionary work was not abandoned, but only
subordinated. In furtherance of his political
plans, Lee secured both money and immigrants
from the eastern States and invoked the
protection of the United States Government.
Since 1820 there had been a party in Congress,
representing a sentiment in the country
outside, which desired to abrogate our treaty
with England and establish our government
over the whole of Oregon Territory. But
notwithstanding an "Oregon fever," developed
by Lee and others, the United States was
not yet ready for any action with regard to
the new territory. In the meantime immigrations
from the western States had brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
the Willamette Valley a number of people
differing in spirit from the missionaries and
not at all in harmony with them. These after
a while outnumbered the adherents of the
Mission. Hence arose three parties in the
Valley of the Willamette, two American and
one British. The new American party was in
favor of forming a provisional government,
which should maintain order until the boundary
question now burning between England and
America should be decided. The missionary
party accepted this as an evil less than the rule
of the Hudson Bay Company, which was the
only established authority. The Canadians
wanted only quiet. As a result, in 1845 was
completed the organization of an independent
commonwealth, which recognized the sovereignty
of neither America nor Great Britain,
but which allowed every man to retain his individual
citizenship under either government
until the territorial question should be settled.
Against the wish of most of the missionary
party, but upon the insistence of the more liberal
Americans, the plan was extended so as
to include the country north of the Columbia
River, and McLoughlin was invited to unite in
this organization. The Chief Factor thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
it wise to put the property of his Company
under the protection of a government which
would probably be formed whether or no, and
therefore he entered the organization.</p>

<p>The seat of the new government was called
by the legislature, "Willamette Falls," but the
place was afterwards incorporated under the
name of Oregon City given it by McLoughlin,
its founder.</p>

<p>There had long been disaffection in England
over McLoughlin's liberal attitude towards the
Americans. A climax was reached when Lieutenants
Warre and Vasouver, who came to the
Columbia River shortly after the formation
of the provisional government, reported
McLoughlin to be a disloyal subject, if not
an unfaithful servant. The Chief Factor's defence
was complete and he was not without
friends, both in the Council of the Company
and in the House of Commons. However,
moved by a combination of considerations, he
resigned his office, retired to Oregon City,
and, after the settlement of the boundary question,
became a citizen of the United States.
For this much-vexed boundary question was
settled by treaty in 1846. Polk was elected
upon the platform, "Fifty-four forty, or fight."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
But more moderate counsels prevailed, and a
compromise was made upon the forty-ninth
parallel of latitude. This determination of
the boundary line had as a result the extinguishing
of the Hudson Bay trade on the
Columbia River, and Vancouver was purchased
by the United States for an army post,
which is still maintained. A town has also
grown up outside the reservation.</p>

<p>Seldom has fate been more ironical than in
its treatment of Dr. McLoughlin. Driven
from Vancouver for his kindness to the missionaries,
he was now defrauded of his claim
at Oregon City by the missionary party,
and to accomplish this iniquity anti-British
prejudice was appealed to, in concealment of
the fact that the doctor had applied for American
citizenship. After his death, restitution
was made to his children. Some of his descendants
now live in Portland.</p>

<p>In presenting a portrait of Dr. McLoughlin
to the Oregon Pioneers, in 1887, on behalf of
the city of Portland, Judge Deady said: "He
stands out to-day in bold relief as the first
man in the history of this country&mdash;the pioneer
of pioneers."</p>

<p>With the passing of Vancouver, Oregon City<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
became the metropolis. And when Oregon
was erected into a Territory of the United
States, in 1848, Portland was as yet only "a
place twelve miles from Oregon City."</p>

<p>Shortly after the incidents mentioned at the
opening of this chapter, Overton sold his interest
to F.W. Pettygrove. A year later
Lovejoy and Pettygrove erected a business
building, known as the "shingle store," on
what is now the corner of Front and Washington
streets. Hitherto known as "the village"
or "Stumptown," the little settlement
was now dignified with the name of Portland.
Lovejoy, who was a native of Boston, wanted
to call the town after his birthplace, but Pettygrove,
who was equally loyal to Maine, preferred
Portland, and the tossing of a coin gave
the choice to Pettygrove. What a pity they
could not have compromised on the Indian
<i>Multnomah</i>! Lovejoy, who was a man of
education and had been prominent in the provisional
government, sold his interest in the
future city to Benjamin Stark and eventually
died a poor man. Other transfers of interest
made Daniel Lounsbury, Stephen Coffin, and
W.W. Chapman partners with Stark in the
ownership of the town site, and under these
four men began the active development of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
town. This development, however, soon met
with a decided check from two events which
in turn led to the subsequent upbuilding and
supremacy of Portland.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_597.jpg"> CITY HALL, PORTLAND.</a><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555"></a></div>

<p>The massacre of Whitman and his companions
at Walla Walla by the Cayuse Indians
led to a war of vengeance, which drew almost
every man who could bear arms away from
normal pursuits. Portland contributed a company
of infantry. The movements of the
troops, which rendezvoused at Portland during
this war, demonstrated its superiority over the
city at the falls as a point of arrival and departure
with regard to the Columbia River.
This discovery was to influence the future
location of the metropolis.</p>

<p>The other event mentioned was the discovery
of gold in California. The immediate
effect of this discovery was a stampede from
Oregon. Portland contained at one time, it is
said, but three adults. Soon, however, the demand
for provisions in California opened up
a lucrative trade in the products of the fertile
Willamette Valley and drew men back to the
soil. This California trade afforded an opportunity
to develop Portland's advantages which<span class="pagenum">[557]</span>
the Cayuse war had emphasized, and which
Lovejoy suspected when he said, "I observed
the masts and booms of vessels which had been
left there and it occurred to me that this was
the place for a town."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_599.jpg"> PORTLAND IN 1850.</a><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557"></a></div>

<p>Up to 1848, the annual arrivals in the Columbia
had ranged from three to eight vessels.
In 1849 there were more than fifty arrivals.
The shore of the Willamette at Portland was
lined with all kinds of vessels, and wharfs and
warehouses were in great demand.</p>

<p>It is upon this command of the two water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>ways,
with her superior port, that the permanent
commercial supremacy of Portland
rests. The most conspicuous name in connection
with this development of Portland's
shipping interests is that of John H. Couch.
In 1840 Captain Couch brought into the Columbia
the first American trader which had
crossed the bar since the Wyeth expedition.
This was the brig <i>Maryland</i>, from Newburyport,
Mass. After subsequent voyages he
brought his family from Newburyport and
settled in Portland, in 1849. In partnership
with his brother-in-law, Captain Flanders, he
built wharfs and warehouses and established
the first regular shipping business in the city.
The first brig sailing from Portland to China,
<i>Emma Preston</i>, was dispatched by Couch &amp;
Co.</p>

<p>Such has been the development of Portland
shipping that it is now well up among the
great ports of the country. Last year (1900),
according to the annual review by the <i>Oregonian</i>,
it was ahead of Philadelphia and
Baltimore. Its wheat shipments (15,858,387
bushels) exceeded those of San Francisco,
and more than equalled the combined shipments
of Tacoma and Seattle.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_601.jpg"> THE PORT OF PORTLAND.</a><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559"></a></div>

<p>Henry Villard's great genius suffered no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
aberration when he selected Portland as the
centre of Pacific coast transportation. For
not only does this city command the waterways,
but it is
also the great
railway centre.
Four transcontinental
systems,
beside local
lines, make the
Union Station
their actual terminus.
The
Hotel Portland,
one of Villard's
many projects,
should be to
Portlanders a
memorial of Villard's
brilliance
and public spirit,
as to the tourist it offers, with its elegance and
comforts, a suggestive contrast to the camp of
the early traveller.</p>

<p>To conclude from Portland's rapid growth
and commercial supremacy that it is a typical
"western" town, would be to strike wide of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
the mark. One must go east from Portland to
find the typical characteristics, good and bad,
of a western town. Portland's character was
largely formed before the railway came, for it
had a population of nearly twenty thousand
before there was connection by rail with the
United States. This population was made
up of the influx from the Willamette Valley,
whose civilization had been deeply impressed
by the religious and educational establishment
at its foundation, and of a good class
of immigrants coming directly from the eastern
States. A characterization of Portland
by Judge Deady, in 1868, is illuminating:
"Theatrical amusements never ranked high.
There is no theatre house in the town fit to
be called such. On the other hand, church-going
is comparatively common."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_605.jpg"> A CORNER IN CHINATOWN.</a><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563"></a></div>

<p>As early as 1849 some citizens of Portland
organized an association, elected trustees, and
built a school and meeting-house at a cost of
over two thousand dollars. This was the first
enterprise of the kind on the coast. Within
a few years all the prominent religious denominations
were represented by houses of worship.
The earliest of these buildings were
those of the Methodists and Congregationalists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
The Methodists, Roman Catholics, and
Episcopalians also supported institutions of
learning and of charity. No single religious
denomination or individual clergyman has exerted
such a commanding influence in the
religious development of the city as to warrant
any attempt at discrimination. It may
be less invidious if two among the many citizens
who have influenced the thought and
ministered to the higher non-ecclesiastical
life of the city should be briefly noticed.
Matthew P. Deady, who was prominent in
the territorial government of Oregon, and
whose was a controlling mind in framing both
the organic and statute law of the State, was,
upon the admission of the State, appointed
Federal Judge, which office he held until his
death. Upon his appointment he secured the
location of the court at Portland, and identified
himself with the city. The city, too, became
identified with him, inasmuch as the
act of its incorporation passed the Legislature
as it came from his hand. Judge Deady ever
strove to promote the higher interests of
Portland, through his important office, which
he filled with great ability; through the institutions
of the Episcopal Church, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
he was an honored member; and through the
various channels which offer themselves to
the public spirited citizen. His monument,
perhaps, is the Public Library, which, with its
fine building, is largely the result of his interest
and efforts; although much of the money
for the building was directly derived from a
bequest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_607.jpg"> THE PORTLAND.</a><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565"></a></div>

<p>When it is known that the <i>Oregonian</i> has
been published in Portland practically since
the foundation of the city, and that it is
deemed by competent judges to be the best
edited newspaper west of the Atlantic coast,
the conclusion is not far away that the man
who has been the editor and master mind of
that journal for more than thirty years must
have wielded an immense influence upon the
thought and opinion of Portland and the
Pacific Northwest. That man is Harvey W.
Scott.</p>

<p>It is needless to say, these two men do not
stand alone. C.E.S. Wood, Esq., might
be named as one who has contributed more
than any, perhaps, to the development of the
city in the appreciation of and interest in art.
Judge George H. Williams, who was Attorney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>-General
in Grant's Cabinet, might be cited as
an example of those who have served the nation
as well as the city. Others, too, have
shared in making Portland, but space forbids
even the mention of their names.</p>

<p>With almost a hundred thousand inhabitants,
drawn from all parts of the world, and
with a "Chinatown" in its midst, the social
character of Portland has, of course, changed
since 1868. And yet Judge Deady's characterization
given then would fairly hold good
to-day. This means, of course, that Portland
is eminently conservative, with the advantages
and disadvantages of conservatism.</p>

<p>In externals, Portland is an attractive city,
with the trees in its streets and the lawns
about its houses and its wonderful roses. Its
early architecture is poor, but many of the
recent buildings, municipal, ecclesiastical, commercial,
domestic, and general, are not only
large and imposing, but good. The city is
beautifully situated, with the rivers at its feet
and the wooded hills behind it, and in the distance
the snow mountains, of which the finest
and the favorite is Hood. Portland sits to-day
mistress of the North Pacific, and with
historic and prophetic reasons for expecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
to be the metropolis of the whole Pacific coast.
If the sceptre slips from her, it will be only
because she lacks the faith, the courage, and
the enterprise to enter into her inheritance.</p>

<p>If Xenophon had journeyed westward from
Athens, pressing beyond the amber caverns
of the Baltic, beyond the tin mines of Thule,
out past the Gates of Hercules, exactly west,
across an ocean and a continent, the next
<i>thalatta</i> of his men would have saluted the
Pacific at the Golden Gate from the low, shifting
sand-hills of the unrisen San Francisco.
For the violet-veiled city of Athene and the
gray-draped city of St. Francis are in one line
of latitude.</p>

<p>San Francisco crowns the extremity of a
long, rugged peninsula, a little north of the
centre of California,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span></p>

<p>The one break in the mountain wall of the
California Coast Range is the Golden Gate,
the watery pass that leads from San Francisco
to the Pacific. Spurs and peaks and cross
ridges of this mountain chain would at long
range seem to encompass the city round about;
but, on nearer view, the edging waters on three
sides make her distinctly a city of the sea.</p>

<p>Looking from the bay, past the fortified
islands of the city, one may see San Francisco
to the west, rising in airy beauty on clustered
gray hills. At night the city hangs against
the horizon like a lower sky, pulsing with
starry lamps. By day it stretches in profile
long and undulating, with spires and domes
climbing up the steeps from a shore lined with
the shipping of every nation&mdash;felucca, ironclad,
merchantman, junk, together with bevies
of tiny busybody craft, all of them circled and
followed by slow-swinging gulls.</p>

<p>For years after the magnificent, all-inclusive
claims of the Cabots at Labrador in 1497,
nothing was known of the west coast of North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
America. Cabrillo felt his way along it in
1542, claiming it for Spain. In 1579, Francis
Drake, fleeing from plundered Spanish galleons,
tarried for repairs beside Cape Reyes,
the Cape of Kings, and claimed the country,
as New Albion, for Elizabeth of England.
Although anchored in a cove within a mile of
San Francisco Bay, he doubtless sailed away
without guessing its existence behind the forest-covered
mountains.</p>

<p>In 1602, Vizcaino, charting the west for
Spain, as Gosnold was mapping the east for
England, made stay in Drake's old anchorage,
and named it the Port of San Francisco.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the reiterated desire of the
Spanish Crown that Mexico, or New Spain,
should set about colonizing upper California,
it was not till 1769 that the work was begun.
Spain needed a harbor in which to retire on
the way from the Philippines. The Russian
fur-traders were heading down the coast. The
French and the English were rumored to be
nearing from the east. So it behooved Spain
to be on the alert to maintain her right to the
new territory.</p>

<p>José de Galvaez, <i>Visitador</i> of Spain, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
had been sent to Mexico with powers extraordinary,
"to examine and reform all branches
of government," seized upon the project of
colonization, and found the administrator of
his plans in Padre Junipero Serra, of fragrant
memory,&mdash;a Franciscan monk, who had all his
life passioned to save Indians as a Tamerlane
would have passioned to destroy them.</p>

<p>Spain's plan of colonization comprehended
a triple series of establishments: the ecclesiastical
or the mission, the military or the presidio,
the civil or the pueblo. The theory of colonization
carried the idea of a military and a
religious conquest of the new lands. The
Indians, whenever belligerent, were to be overcome
by force; but as far as possible, they were
to be drawn into the mission life by peaceable
expedients.</p>

<p>In 1769, four expeditions, composed of
soldiers, settlers, and Franciscan friars, set out
from Mexico to enter upon the work of colonizing
and civilizing California. If in the mists
of coming ages the Æneid of California be
lost, Spain may prove her sponsorship of the
Californian province by the litany of seraphic
and apostolic names given to mountain and
mesa, to coast and cañon. Andalusian names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
of saints and angels chime wherever the padres
stepped or stopped.</p>

<p>One of the four expeditions, pushing northward
by land, unwittingly passed Monterey;
and a fragment of the company, while out
hunting, came suddenly in sight of the waters
now known as the Golden Gate and the San
Francisco Bay. For the name San Francisco
was soon transferred to this greater water from
the old port known to Drake and Vizcaino.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1776 a company of padres,
soldiers, and families, with stock and seeds,
arrived on the San Francisco peninsula, and
built temporary shelter of brush and tulès
plastered with mud. On September 17th, the
feast of the stigmata of St. Francis, solemn
possession was taken of the presidio in the
name of Spain; and on October 4th, the day
of St. Francis, the mission was formally
dedicated. The cross was raised, the Te
Deum was chanted, while bells and guns
chorused to sea and sky.</p>

<p>The mission was in a little fertile valley
four miles from the Presidio, near a small
creek now filled in. It became known as the
Mission de los Dolores, in honor of the sorrows
of Mary.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_617.jpg"> THE DISCOVERY OF SAN FRANCISCO BAY. FROM THE PAINTING BY A.F. MATHEWS.</a><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575"></a></div>

<p>Hostile tribes from the south had lately fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
upon the Indians of the peninsula, firing their
<i>rancherias</i>, murdering many of the inhabitants,
and terrorizing the rest into flight. So the
savages proved scarce at first. Even in 1802
the Indians at the Mission numbered only about
eight hundred. But these natives, like all the
Californian Indians, though quite docile, proved
stupid and brutish and lazy. They made little
progress from savagery to the state of <i>gentes
de razon</i>, or "reasonable beings," fit to populate
the pueblos.</p>

<p>This mission <i>régime</i>, however futile it may
have been, however formal and external its
religious training, seems to have touched
upon some of the educational and sociological
thought of our own time. It made use of the
wisdom Spain had learned from her Roman
conquerors&mdash;the taking of the conquered into
full partnership. The idea of the daily contact
of superior with inferior; of community of
property and co-operation in labor; of the
union of manual work with mental drill&mdash;all
these were rudely exemplified in the mission
life. Sixty years was the span of the experiment,
a brief time for an effort in civilization.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_619.jpg"> MISSION DOLORES. BUILT IN 1776.</a><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577"></a></div>

<p>The Mission Dolores grew after the general<span class="pagenum">[577]</span>
plan of the score of others in California. It
was built about an open court, the place for
work or recreation. The chapel stood at one
end of the rectangle; the living rooms, storehouses,
and shops lined the other sides. Only
the chapel, thrice restored, with its <i>campo
santo</i> beside it, remains of the Dolores structure.
When Beechy visited it in 1829, it was
already a crumbling ruin. The sun-dried
bricks, here as at the other unprotected mission
relics, are fast melting back into the earth.
The adobe, like the swallow's nest, cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
endure the hammers and chisels of wind and
rain and sun.</p>

<p>Little of moment occurred at Dolores till
the days of secularization. The barren, sand-driven,
wind-swept hills were not attractive to
the Spanish, and the Mission was not in high
estimation with the authorities. Don Pedro
de Aberini wrote of it in 1776: "Of all sites
in California this Mission is situated upon the
worst." Nevertheless, in 1825, the Mission,
from a few head of stock and a few sacks of
seed brought in 1776, had accumulated 76,000
cattle, 79,000 sheep, 40,000 horses, and $60,000
in money and products.</p>

<p>Mexico's jealousy of the sympathy which
the padres felt for Spain, from whom Mexico
had torn herself in 1822; the clamoring of
settlers for the lands held by the missions;
quixotic pleas of Mexican statesmen for Indian
autocracy; and perhaps, under all, an
itching for the Pious Fund that supported the
mission work&mdash;these led on to the secularization
of the missions in 1836. The Indian,
civilized only surface-deep, was unready for
civilized self-government; and so he fell back
to barbarism, plus dissipation&mdash;his last state
worse than the first.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span></p>

<p>The Dolores Indians were especially incompetent,
and no attempt was made to organize
a pueblo for them. So Dolores, after secularization,
dragged out an anomalous existence
as a lapsed mission, carried on by political
rather than by ecclesiastical rule, with an alcalde
rather than a padre in charge.</p>

<p>In 1835 the embarcadero of Yerba Buena
two miles from the Presidio, was, at command
of Governor Figueroa, made the port of entry.
This place (named from a medicinal weed
growing about the cove) was only a landing-place
for fishermen and hide droghers. Only
one house stood here at this time. Not a sail
shadowed the bay. Herds of deer came
down to the water and schools of seal swam
to the shore. Yet Yerba Buena afterward absorbed
the Mission and the Presidio on the
margin of Golden Gate, and took the name of
the Bay, thus becoming the germ of the present
city.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the charm and worth of
the sovereign bay queening the western shore
of North America was rapidly travelling the
world. In 1806, the Russian Rezanof had
visited it officially. His coming and going
has a romantic interest, as his betrothal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
Doña Concepcion, the beautiful daughter of
Arguello, commandant of the Presidio, his
tragic death on his way home, and her retirement
to a convent, made the Evangeline tale
of early California. England in 1840 sent
Belcher to the bay to gather information, and
France sent de Mofras.</p>

<p>Both of these nations were suspected of
coveting the California province; and the
hope of getting possession of it, especially of
San Francisco Bay, was doubtless in the background
of our national consciousness as one
motive of the Mexican War. It was felt by
our country that the United States must own
the west coast or be pot-bound later on. The
Government offered to buy the territory from
Mexico, but the proposal was refused.</p>

<p>Gradually it came to be known that the
United States, fearing similar action by European
powers, was to seize and hold California
in the event of a war with Mexico. With the
vexed question of motive and action this is
not the place to deal. But in 1846, after the
Mexican War had fairly started, Frémont,
pursuing a scientific exploration in California,
received secret Government advices, and, gathering
troops in the North, urged a declaration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
of independence. Commodore Sloat, in command
of a frigate at Monterey, in July, 1846,
raised the American flag in place of the Spanish
nopal and eagle standard, declaring California
a part of the United States. The next
day, following the order of Sloat, our flag was
set flying in the plaza at Yerba Buena by the
captain of a frigate in the bay, accompanied
by an escort of soldiers and marines. No opposition
was offered by the Mexicans. Portsmouth,
the name of the vessel, was given to
the plaza, and Montgomery, the name of the
captain, was given to the street, then along
the water front, but now pushed back a half a
dozen blocks by the filling in of the cove.</p>

<p>The first alcalde of Yerba Buena under the
American flag was Washington Bartlett.
Hearing that a new town, Francesca, was to
be established farther up the bay, and fearing
injury to his own from one with a name so
similar to that of the bay, Alcalde Bartlett
proceeded, in 1847, to cast the plebeian
name of his pueblo. He declared the name
Yerba Buena insignificant and unknown to
the world; proclaimed that henceforth the
settlement should bear the name of the fostering
bay beside it. This somewhat tardy edict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
was accepted by all, and San Francisco became
a name to conjure with.</p>

<p>The village nucleated a little back of the
cove about its inevitable Spanish plaza, which
was to be the scene of wild and whirling days
to come. Telegraph Hill, the old observation
station, rose on the north of it, and
Rincon Hill was off toward the south. When
California was ceded to the United States in
1848, San Francisco was fairly afoot upon her
triumphant way. Brannan had established a
newspaper, <i>The Star</i>, and had sent two thousand
copies East, describing the new land, and,
curiously enough, prophesying the gold and
the wheat of the future&mdash;the first "boom"
note from California. A school was flourishing;
churches were building; two hundred
houses were on the hills, and the population
was about eight hundred.</p>

<p>And now sweeps into the story the dominant
major&mdash;the finding of the gold. Told
of in Indian legend and in Spanish tradition,
the shining sands of Pactolus were found at
last in a Californian cañon. San Franciscans,
hearing the tale, felt again the wander spirit,
and were off to the mountains, seeking quicker
fortunes. Soldiers and sailors deserted from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
the bay. The school closed; the newspaper
suspended. Business was at a standstill:
there was no one to work or to buy.</p>

<p>A wind of excitement passed across two
hemispheres. The tidings of the gold flashed
from city to city, swift as the signal fires of
Agamemnon telling that Troy had fallen.
The faces of men turned expectantly toward
this land at the edge of the world. Everywhere
were heard the sounds of preparation
and farewell, as adventurers by land and sea,
by craft and caravan, set out for El Dorado.</p>

<p>By 1849 immigrants from the ends of the
earth were pouring in; and the bare, brown
hills and curving shores of San Francisco
were whitening with tents. Goods were piled
high in the open air, and all available walls
were covered with grotesque signs and placards
speaking in all languages.</p>

<p>By the winter of '49, the drowsy, droning
Spanish town had expanded into a little excited
city. Everywhere were springing up
nondescript lodging and boarding houses,
drinking houses, and gambling saloons. Twenty-five
thousand people thronged the thoroughfares.
There was scarcely such a thing as
a home. Crowds of people slept wedged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
together on floors and tables, in rows of cots
or in bunks fastened in tiers to the walls.
The streets, full of sticky clay and miry sand,
were thronged with struggling horses, mules,
and oxen; and crowds of men from all nations
and all levels of life jostled by, laughing,
railing, or cursing. A whirlwind had rushed
in upon the sleepy town. Old habits of life
were broken through. Lawyers were turned
into draymen and bootblacks; doctors into
merchants and carpenters; soldiers into waiters
and auctioneers. All men could find
work; and none, however rich, could wholly
evade it. Gambling was the chief amusement;
speculation in a hundred forms was
pressing forward, and fortunes were changing
hourly.</p>

<p>In all this rude democracy, there was one
mark of an aristocracy&mdash;high prices. Workmen
charged twenty dollars a day; lumber
was five hundred dollars a thousand; flour
was forty dollars a barrel; eggs were a dollar
apiece.</p>

<p>All unready for this tumultuous rise in
population and precipitation of business, the
infant city had to evolve on the moment accommodation
for man and beast and craft,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
and organization for civic safety. To add to
the perplexities, in the first years of the city,
fire after fire devoured its flimsy fabric of
canvas and shingle. The fourth and worst
fire, in May, 1851, destroyed seven million
dollars' worth of property. The recurrent
devastation made a demand for fireproof
buildings, which gave a certain stability and
dignity to the city. The bay began to fill
with the new clipper ships, which brought
steadier crews and more rational cargoes than
did the older clumsy ships now rotting at the
docks. Secure wharfage, passable streets, an
efficient fire-department began to give a feeling
of prosperity and permanence.</p>

<p>San Francisco was the stopping-place of
every comer and goer; the Egypt of the
corn, the depot of supplies for the gold
territory. Naturally, forces of good and evil
streamed into the young city and came into
collision. Strange new conditions were in
the environment. The old primitive safeguards
of the early mission era were outgrown.
The population, representing every
form of tradition and government, found itself
removed from well-nigh all restraints, all
bolstering-up of church and state. Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
man of worth, while bent to his private task,
had forced upon him the problem of helping
to build up a social fabric and of holding it
secure.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon has an elastic genius for
government. Wherever he goes, finding new
conditions, he finds new ways for maintaining
the public safety. The reaction of his spirit
under the conditions about him in early California
furnishes an interesting study in social
dynamics.</p>

<p>By 1850, California was running under a
State constitution and the city had a charter.
The old stable forces of home, and school,
and church, the Argonaut soon evolved about
him. However, great freedom of action
and opinion prevailed, and a tolerance of
evil that well-nigh blunted the distinctions
between right and wrong. "Sydney coves,"
and other unruly spirits took advantage of this
laxity. Abuses thickened, and anxious problems
of public order were upon the young
metropolis.</p>

<p>The affair of "The Hounds" was one of
the organized outrages that confronted the
municipality. A band of lawless ex-convicts,
affiliated for mutual protection in evil designs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
grew very obnoxious in their bold defiance
of authority, their open and wanton outrages
upon citizens, especially foreigners. The
community, having no municipal organization,
rose against the law-breakers, put twenty
on trial, and half of these into prison. This
show of public indignation quieted the pack
for a time. But there was no strong authority
to conserve the public good. What was the
concern of all found an executive in none.</p>

<p>Yet, finally, out of this sagging and sinking
of the public order and its adjustment sprang
the most spectacular popular uprising and the
most notable object-lesson in self-government
known to the West or perhaps to any other
land,&mdash;the Vigilance Committee of 1852-56.
The occasion of this citizens' uprising was
a series of unpunished crimes of arson, murder,
rapine, and burglary. The perpetrators
of these outrages, owing to lax administration
of law by corrupt or careless officials, seemed
immune from apprehension or punishment.
The many fires that had devastated the
infant city had without doubt been of incendiary
origin. Over a hundred murders had
occurred in a few months and not a single
capital punishment had followed.<span class="pagenum">[588]</span></p>

<p>Feeling that this insecurity of life and
property was intolerable, and fearing that
it would draw down the perils and uncertainties
of mob law, a party of prominent citizens,
all above suspicion of self-interest, organized
a defensive league against the allied rabble.
They determined to take the law into their
own hands, and to administer it with equal
and exact justice, with swiftness and finality.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_630.jpg"> SEAL OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE.</a><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588"></a></div>

<p>The first and most exciting case handled
by this extraordinary court of justice came
swiftly to judgment. Upon the night of
organization, in June, 1852, an ex-convict was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
seized in an act of theft. He was tried in the
presence of eighty members sitting with closed
doors; was convicted, sentenced, and hanged
in Portsmouth Square that night. The general
public, sensitive and suspicious, dreading mob
tactics, was troubled at first by this summary
show of power. But the Committee came out
with a complete list of its members, each
member assuming equal share of responsibility,
each avowing the public welfare as the
only end in view, each pledging his life, his
fortune, his honor, for the protection of his
city and the upholding of the public safety.
A profound impression was made by the
manifesto of this self-constituted protectorate.
When it was found that no secret society, but,
instead, a band of the solid men of the city
was at the head of the movement, the community
rallied to its support with enthusiasm.
The Committee quietly kept at its work of
investigation and punishment. Its calm, swift
justice, its lack of personal bias, its righteous
vengeance terrified evil-doers. Many were
banished by formal warning. Three other
well-known criminals were hanged. Crime
rapidly diminished, and for the first time in
years people began to feel secure in person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
and possessions. After thirty days the occupation
of the Vigilance Committee was gone.
It did not disband, but existed for years a
merely nominal tribunal.</p>

<p>By 1854, the growth of San Francisco
began to slacken. Inflation began its inevitable
counter-movement of collapse. The days
of picking up gold were over. Immigration
fell off. A large part of the city's population
scattered, returning East, or going into the
country to try life on ranch or range. Disorder
increased; the old suppressed crimes
leaped into evil eminence.</p>

<p>A new journal, <i>The Bulletin</i>, edited by
James King, of William, assailed the rising
corruption, political and personal, social and
individual, public and private.</p>

<p>In 1856, without warning, King was shot
down in the street by a man who had writhed
under the torment of the <i>Bulletin</i> pens,&mdash;an
unscrupulous ex-convict, James Casey, a rival
editor, and a man lately elected supervisor.
This murder precipitated public opinion, and
exploded the lazy optimism that had waited for
things to right themselves. Casey was at once
jailed, by chance escaping lynching. It was
inevitable that heroic measures should be set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
in operation. And so there came about a second
administration of the Vigilance Committee,
this unique social providence, this people's
protectorate. But this time it had before it
not only the purging of the city's crime, but
also a struggle with jealous and sluggish authority
vested in city and State officials.
In a few days 2500 men had enrolled as
Vigilantes, and were drilling in arms, under
their former trusted President, William T.
Coleman. Meantime the Governor of the
State was summoned by the Anti-Vigilantes,
representing chiefly the conservative officeholders
and the people affiliated in some way
with the lawless element. These Anti-Vigilantes
came to be known in derision as the
Law-and-Order Party. The Know-Nothing
Governor swayed first from one side to another.
He had no power behind him, for the
militia were deserting to the popular cause.</p>

<p>The Vigilantes took charge not only of Casey,
but also of one Cora who had wantonly shot
a United States marshal and had evaded punishment.
After a dispassionate trial, with all
form and ceremony, the two criminals were
sentenced to death and hanged on the day
of King's funeral. It may be worth remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>ing
that this man Cora was defended in his
first trial by the eloquent Col. E.D. Baker.</p>

<p>The Law-and-Order Party now insisted that
the Vigilantes disband. But the Committee
held that its purpose was not simply to deal
out justice to murderers, but also to so clarify
the social atmosphere as to make future assassinations
punishable by law. Therefore it
struck directly at city politics, banishing the
openly vicious, and laying the way for a clean
administration when the corrupt officials could
be rotated out of office.</p>

<p>This Vigilance Committee drew a large following
of citizens; but there was a continuous
undercurrent of opposition. General Sherman,
commander of the second division of the
State militia, backed by the vacillating Governor
and representing constitutional authority,
was the leader of the opposition sentiment.
In June, the Law-and-Order Party under him
determined to rise against the Vigilantes. He
appealed to General Wool, United States
Commander in the Department, for arms, and
also to Commodore Farragut at Mare Island.
These commanders declined to interfere in
State troubles without orders from the Government.
Governor Johnson declared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
city and county of San Francisco in a state of
insurrection, and asked aid from Washington.
General Sherman, finding himself powerless,
resigned. Chief-Justice Terry, an active opponent
of the Committee, having come from
Sacramento to enforce the law, now complicated
matters by stabbing an officer of the
Vigilantes. The Committee held him a prisoner
but set him free when his victim recovered.
After three months of life, after hanging
in all four criminals, well-known desperadoes,
banishing many others, and paving the way for
a purer administration of law, the Committee
disbanded, leaving a small body to settle its
affairs. The next election saw a full set of
honest officials in power, and for twenty years
San Francisco had the name of being one
of the best-governed cities in the world.</p>

<p>Looking back dispassionately, it appears
that the Vigilance Committee had something
of the dignity and purpose and procedure of
the ancient court of the Areopagus. It was
not like the extemporized Sanhedrim that tried
Christ, a body which kept the appearance of
justice but mocked the reality. It was not a
masked band of regulators like the Ku Klux
or the White Caps; but it was an irresistible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
rising of the best citizens in calm debate, in
open daylight, with sobriety and decorum and
every safeguard of justice. Unlike the anti-Mafia
of New Orleans, it put down the mob
spirit, but did not engender it. Though acting
outside of the constituted authorities, it had
the severest reverence for law in the ideal. As
President Coleman expressed it, the Committee
did not act under lynch law, but under a
sort of martial law that obtains in time of
siege. Considering the daring wantonness of
crime, the subsidized or terrorized condition
of the courts of justice, and the immunity of
criminals, law-abiding citizens seem to have
been justified in reverting to the elemental order
of things, as is the man who attacks the
thief in the night. But, of course, loyalty from
the first to public interests instead of easy
optimism and self-absorption, would have held
back the occasion for the heroic measures of
the historic Committee. Men never learn,
save through suffering, that the support of the
common welfare is a sacred duty, and that
this duty squares exactly with their highest
private interests.</p>

<p>During all these years and long after, San
Francisco suffered greatly from disputed land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
titles. Conflicting claims led to labyrinthine
legislation, and increasing hardship, one crisis
being the Squatter Riots.</p>

<p>The treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo had decreed
that all property rights should be respected
by the new government. So property
rights founded on cloudy and ill-understood
laws and customs of Spain and Mexico had
now to be adjudicated in the Californian courts.
San Francisco was entangled in the mazes of
two rival Spanish claims, embracing well-nigh
all her territory except the "made" land.
There was much dispute as to whether or not
the city had ever been made a pueblo proper.
On this depended the holding or forfeiting of
four square leagues of land. Though the city
petitioned the Land Commission in 1852 for
confirmation of her public grants, the controversy
was pending through wearying legislation,
with repeated surveys and delays and
continual jeopardy of property, until finally
settled by the decision of Secretary Lamar in
1887.</p>

<p>The decline of the gold output brought to
the front the agricultural resources of the
State, and San Francisco came to be the centre
of distribution for wheat, wines, and fruits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span></p>

<p>The Central Pacific Railroad was completed
in 1867, with San Francisco as the Western
terminus, and as by a magic stroke the city was
only three thousand miles instead of nineteen
thousand miles from Eastern markets. Since
then three other transcontinental lines and
numerous local lines have brought trade and
travel into this emporium of the Pacific, while
the ships of all nations fetch and carry through
her Golden Gate.</p>

<p>The war of secession found California
wavering between the Stars and Stripes and
the Stars and Bars. A large Southern element,
much to the front in politics, had maintained
a strong Democratic influence in the
State. The celebrated duel, just outside the
city limits between Broderick and Terry&mdash;the
Terry of Vigilance Committee memory&mdash;turned
the tide toward Republicanism and
sympathy for the North. The duel grew out
of the Broderick and Gwin senatorial contest.
Terry stood for Southern chivalry; Broderick
stood for free labor and progressive politics.
Not essentially great or noble, Broderick
was made heroic by his tragic death. During
war times he was a colossal figure in men's
minds, and his anti-slavery sentiments echoed<span class="pagenum">[597]</span>
through city and State, a slogan and a cleaving
sword for freedom and the North.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_639.jpg"> UNION DEPOT.</a><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597"></a></div>

<p>In the '70's there sprang up in San Francisco
a tremendous excitement over the silver
mines on the Comstock Lode. The bonanza
was estimated to be worth over fifteen hundred
millions of dollars. True, this argent
field was across the Sierras, in the State of
Nevada. But most of the output found its
way to San Francisco. The principal owners
lived there, and San Francisco was the depot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
for Comstock supplies. The Stock Board
operated there, and stocks bought for less
than one hundred thousand dollars soared
up to two hundred million. At the highest
notch of prices the manipulators sold out,
and the airy fabric of speculation fell with a
crash. The banks had been emptied by speculators
eager to buy stocks, and were greatly
embarrassed. Myriads were swept into poverty,
leaving immense fortunes in the hands
of a few.</p>

<p>Soon after the Comstock collapse the Sand
Lot agitation sprang into life. Over one hundred
and fifty millions of dollars had been
removed from circulation by the Comstock
jugglery. The wealth of the outside world
was temporarily diverted from the San Francisco
markets. A great drought had been on
the State during two years and the lean kine
had devoured the fat. Harvests were sparse
or wholly lacking. Cattle perished beside the
dry watercourses. A large body of the outside
unemployed had come to swell the tide
of the city's drifting, workless ones. The
railroad was threatening a reduction of wages
to its thousands of men. Riots were on in
Philadelphia, Pittsburg, Baltimore, and had
sent contagion on the enforced idlers in San<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
Francisco. Feeling long smouldering broke
into fire against the Chinese and the railroad,
two factors believed by the working-men to be
largely instrumental in cheapening wages and
robbing men of work. A mob gathered, threatening
to rout out the Asiatics. The police
could not disperse the rioters.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_641.jpg"> CHINESE PHARMACY.</a><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599"></a></div>

<p>On July 24th there came a third call for the
Vigilance Committee to assemble, which many
thought an unnecessary and high-handed summons.
William T. Coleman was for a third
time given charge. The Committee was to
proceed upon lines followed in the '50's. But
this time they were to co-operate with the
authorities rather than to work in opposition.
On July 25th, the mob, infuriated by the
menace of the Committee and looking on it
as a mere support of capitalistic interests,
gathered about the Pacific Mail Dock, where
immigrant Chinese were landed. The Committee,
armed with pick-handles, met the labor
mob at the dock and a few men were killed.
This ended the uprising. But the issue was
soon thrust into politics. The anti-Chinese
believers gathered upon the sand lots in the
neighborhood of the City Hall and organized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
the Working-man's Party. It spread throughout
the State. Dennis Kearny, an illiterate
but rudely eloquent speaker, became the leader,
the Wat Tyler of the hour. The movement
ended in the adoption by the State of a new
Constitution framed along progressive lines.</p>

<p>The people of San Francisco are of all kindreds
and tongues. Buddha, Mahomet, and
Confucius are prayed to beside the Christian
temples. The Indians of the Mission have
faded from the peninsula and the sombreroed
Spaniard dashes no more from the Mission to
the beach about his bull-fights and bear-baitings.
But here are Anglo-Saxons, Teutons,
Celts, Greeks, Slavs, Latins, Hindus, Chinese,
Kanakas, Japanese, and Chilenos, all mixing
in the great crucible and slowly shaping a
new type of man, the Western American.
All seem to be mixing, it should be explained,
except the Chinese, for, after a quarter of
a century of experience, San Francisco feels
that her Chinese population is still an alien
body and sure to remain so even to the third
and fourth generation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_645.jpg"> CHINESE GROCERY STORE.</a><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603"></a></div>

<p>The problem of Chinese immigration has
come up again and again in San Francisco.
In 1869 the Chinese were invited and welcomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
from China. In 1892, the Geary law was
passed prohibiting the coming of any but the
student class and providing for deportation
under certain conditions. A generation grew
up between this hail and farewell, China in
the meantime pouring her tens of thousands of
coolies into San Francisco. California welcomes
any race that affiliates. But she has
found that the Chinese race is not as the
impressionable Indian or negro; but is an arrested
race in the yoke of caste and ancient
tradition, one looking with contempt upon
upstart Anglo-Saxon civilization. The Chinese
swarmed into a quarter of the city about
Portsmouth Square, and have made there a
small, evil-smelling Canton, where only a
foreign tongue is spoken, and where strange
gods are worshipped. Few have brought
wives. Slave girls are the only women. Every
Chinese prays to die in China, or to have
his bones rot there. American law to most
of them is but a pestilent thing to be evaded.
They have no interest in the growth of the
country or its institutions. They work for
starvation wages, their living being extremely
cheap, requiring only tea and rice and a bare
shelf to sleep upon in a room crowded with such<span class="pagenum">[603]</span>
shelves. Being imitative, and as patient as cattle,
and withal so cheap as hirelings, they have
taken the places of women in the household
and factory and the places of men and boys
in the work of dock and shop and field. The
assertion that this labor liberates the whites
for higher work does not seem to be verified.
Many trace the vicious "hoodlum" class of
both sexes to the enforced idleness of these
young people, springing from the iron competition
of the Chinese in the labor market.<span class="pagenum">[604]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_646.jpg"> SMOKING ROOM, CHINESE RESTAURANT.</a><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604"></a></div>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, the little slant-eyed
men with their grotesque superstitions,
their stiff, stark, unhomelike homes, add a
quaintness and a touch of color to this romantic
city. Gay placards of intense greens
and vermilions flutter from their doorposts.
Under the dull outer tunics of the elders
gleam surtouts of gay brocades, while the few
children, little faithful copies of their sires,
all tricked out like the lanterns of the night,
go toddling on tiny, rocking shoes through the
narrow, dingy streets. The Chinese theatres,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
temples, and restaurants are full of the Oriental
strangeness. The interiors of some of them
are lacquered and varnished like huge tea-boxes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_647.jpg"> A BUSINESS CENTRE.</a><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605"></a></div>

<p>As one gets a strip of Cathay in Chinatown,
so he may find a corner of Italy on the
south slopes of Telegraph Hill. Here children,
looking like the cherubs of their kinsmen,
the old masters, swarm through steep narrow
streets, upon curious little balconies, out of
odd windows, or upon the steps of chapels.</p>

<p>The architecture of San Francisco is a
medley of many schools. The buildings,
especially the homes, are largely of wood;
the recurring feature is the bay window
that focuses the light and heat. To the
newcomer they all seem of the same color,
for the fogs and winds soon reduce all hues
to a fine, restful gray. In the beginning, by
a curious irony, stone and lumber were shipped
from the East and from Asia to this land
of forests and granite to build some of the
structures still holding their places against
the pressure of time. In the newer buildings
of the city there is some attempt to make
the architecture express the function of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
structure&mdash;the stability of the business house,
the aspiration of the church, the simple
security of the home. The new City Hall
is an example of permanence and chaste elegance.
The old mission architecture is being
revived. This Spanish-Moorish adaptation is
the most characteristic and harmonious development
of Californian architecture. Built
of the earth, the old mission piles seem almost
as if not made by man, but nature. For they
repeat in long stretches and low swells the
contour of the hills about them, and give back
their color-tones of dun and tan and rusty
red.</p>

<p>The year the new and greater name was
given to the city, a misfortune fell upon the
streets. Regardless of cliff and curve, ignoring
height and hollow, the streets were laid
out in undeviating straight lines. And so a
city on fairer than Roman hills, with circling
waterways more lovely than the curve of
Constantinople's Golden Horn, was deformed
as far as its high bearing could be hurt; was
checkered by pitiless compass lines, when it
might have had windings and slow curves and
gentle slopes.</p>

<p>Market, the main street, runs lengthwise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>
the peninsula. Its intersection with Kearny is
a nerve-centre of the city, whence radiate three
great streets. Near this spot are the main
newspaper buildings and most of the large hotels.
San Francisco's
streets,
unlike those of
Sacramento and
Los Angeles, are
not lined with
trees. But nearly
every dooryard
has its green
place where tall
geraniums, camelias,
heliotropes,
or fuchias
fling out, the
year round,
their splashes
of scarlet and
purple.</p>

<span class="caption">PRAYER BOOK CROSS, GOLDEN GATE PARK.</span>
</div>

<p>The city boasts of one great park of a
thousand acres, on the hills and ravines out
by the sea. Central, Prospect, and Fairmount
parks of the East fail beside the charm of this
Arcadian Western park, probably the finest<span class="pagenum">[609]</span>
in North America. The trees of the world,
from conifer to cactus, are here, and every
flower that blooms. Beyond the park is the
Cliff House, overhanging huge rocks, the rendezvous
of gulls and seals and shy things of
the water.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_651.jpg"> SEAL ROCK AND CLIFF HOUSE.</a><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609"></a></div>

<p>The old Portsmouth Square is dingy and
draggled. It looks upon the scene of the executions
of the Vigilantes and is full of memories
for the chronicler. Its great charm
now is the statue of Robert Louis Stevenson,
who when in San Francisco, often sat there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
studying the quaint, broken life about him.
Another significant monument, poetic and historic
presented to the city by Mayor James
D. Phelan, stands before the new City Hall
in honor of the Native Son of the Golden
West.</p>

<p>It is doubtless only a question of time when
expanding San Francisco will absorb the cities
an hour's ride across the Bay,&mdash;Oakland, Berkeley,
and Alameda,&mdash;the homes now of many
of San Francisco's business men.</p>

<p>The University of California at Berkeley
draws its largest clientele from San Francisco.
By the benefactions of the widow of Senator
Hearst of San Francisco, this university has
under way a housing perhaps the most spacious
and symmetrical in the world. The
structure, to cost nearly five million dollars,
follows a plan chosen by experts from designs
submitted after a world competition, and will
crown a long hill slope, looking down on San
Francisco City and Bay and out toward sleeping
Asia. The allied professional colleges of
the University are already in San Francisco.
Its art department is in the fine old mansion
of Hopkins, the railroad builder, on California
Street, the home street of millionaires. A
school of mechanic arts, endowed by the pioneer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
James Lick, who gave the great astronomical
observatory to the State University, is
also under way in San Francisco.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_653.jpg"> CITY HALL, SAN FRANCISCO.</a><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611"></a></div>

<p>Another university
drawing
its student body
largely from San
Francisco is an
hour or more
down the peninsula
from the
city,&mdash;the Leland
Stanford,
Jr., founded by
Jane and Leland
Stanford and
wife, of San
Francisco. This
university, by
the way, is built,
after the old
mission plan of one-story buildings, about an
inner court, with arcades and Roman towers
and tiled roof.</p>

<p>The city has three great working libraries,
the Public, the Mercantile, and the Mechanics'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span>
Institute. Adolph Sutro, the late owner of
about one tenth of the territory of San Francisco
City and County, whose fine grounds out
by the Cliff House have long been open to
the public, left a unique collection of two hundred
thousand pamphlets and volumes of rare
worth, gathered
for the public use.
The Bancroft Library
is phenomenal
in that it has
cornered all the
original material
for the history of
the far West.
Those myriads of
manuscripts, pamphlets,
and books
have been indexed
by experts and the
library is a sort of Vatican for California.</p>

<p>The Bohemian Club of San Francisco, a
comradery of litterateurs, artists, and lovers of
the arts, is a unique expression of the æsthetic
individuality of the city, and is one of its
strong social forces.</p>

<span class="caption">THOMAS STARR KING.</span></div>

<p>San Francisco has perhaps no famous name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
that dominates the city as Franklin dominates
Philadelphia; as Beecher, Brooklyn; as Carnegie,
Pittsburg. But if great-hearted Thomas
Starr King had lived longer, he might have
been its crowning personality as he is now its
most sainted memory. His inflexible loyalty
and impassioned eloquence made him at the
outbreak of the Civil War a commanding
figure, if not the leading citizen of California.</p>

<p>Though only fifty years old, San Francisco
has given to literature and art a few names
that the world will not willingly let die. For
forty years Joaquin Miller, the "Poet of the
Sierras," has been a friend and neighbor of her
hills and waters, telling in noble numbers the
glories and the terrors of the strange new land
"by the sundown seas." Here Bret Harte
founded the <i>Overland Monthly</i> and with "The
Luck of Roaring Camp" began his creation of
Californian characters. What matters it if
they never existed outside of his pages,&mdash;those
drinking, dirking dare-devils, those tenor-voiced,
soulful-eyed gamblers, striking sorrow
to the hearts of ladies? For, touched by his
genius, they exist for us there, in perennial
charm and invitation.</p>

heard round the world, declaring that

to surge and thunder on the shores of Balboa's
Sea. But this end is only a beginning&mdash;this

into life on these circling shores, making the

<h2>MONTEREY<br />

CIUDAD DE AYER Y DE HOY</h2>

<p class="chapby">By HAROLD BOLCE</p>


<p>To know the story of Monterey, one must go
back for a moment to the southern coast
of Europe. There, on an island a day's sail from
the land that later cradled a prodigy destined to
make dynasties his playthings, there was born,
in 1713, a boy who by pacific conquests was to
perform a part no less significant than Napoleon's
in determining the history of nations.</p>

<p>While the infant Bonaparte was listening,
perhaps impatiently, to Corsican lullabies,
Junípero Serra, a mendicant friar from Majorca,
discovered, or rediscovered, on the far
shores of this continent the supposedly vanished
harbor of Monterey, and thereby marked
the genesis of the movement that was finally
to give the American republic a western
frontage on the sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>But for this auspicious event and the stimulating
effect on Spanish exploration it afterwards
provoked, the great domain from San
Diego to the Straits of Juan de Fuca would
not to-day be
rendering tribute
to the
Government at
Washington.
The western
lines of the
Louisiana Purchase
would
mark our farthermost
frontier;
the incredible
hoard
of California's
roaring camps
would be minted
into sovereigns,
shillings, rubles, imperials, or francs;
no Pacific Squadron would have carried our
flag to the gates of the East; and we would
to-day be a hemmed-in nation, disputing our
land boundaries with encroaching colonies of
Europe, instead of a world power projecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span>
canals to sever continents in the interest of our
trade, and sailing our ships east and west across
the seven seas.</p>

<p>The average tourist, viewing the adobe ruins
of the Monterey presidio and recalling the futile
guns of that crumbled fortress, does not dream
of the place Monterey filled in the march
of international events. Nor will the guide
enlighten him as he takes him over the seagirt
drive to Carmel and the cliffs of Point
Lobos, for that profane, though picturesque
historian omits even to say that Robert Louis
Stevenson furnished the plan for this famous
highway.</p>

<p>Some gleams of Monterey's immortal past
illumine the reverent traveller who climbs the
stone steps of Junípero's Mission at Carmel.
He knows, then, vaguely, that he is exploring
the venerable tomb of one of the great men
of the world. And the irreverent guide, if
asked, will indicate indifferently the spot on
the gospel side of the sanctuary where rest the
bones of this prophet and builder of empire,
but before the hurrying train-catcher has returned
to the Golden Gate he has ceased to
reflect upon the incalculable debt America
owes to this mendicant seer and colonizer<span class="pagenum">[620]</span>
who, in the name of God, St. Francis, and the
King, added half a continent to the Crown of
Spain, and, building better than he knew, established
the western foundations of the republic
that was to rise above Spanish and
Mexican decay.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_662.jpg"> CARMEL MISSION (RESTORED).</a><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620"></a></div>

<p>Monterey was an old name on the crude
maps of the Mexican frontier. Eighteen
years before the <i>Mayflower</i> landed at Plymouth
Rock, Don Sebastian Vizcaino had
rounded the pine-edged promontory that
hides the harbor of Monterey, and, anchoring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
in the bay, went ashore and with sacred rites
named the port in honor of Count de Monterey,
the reigning Viceroy. For more than
a century and a half the spot was not revisited
save by savage hunters. Efforts to relocate
the harbor were without success.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_663.jpg"> TWILIGHT&mdash;MONTEREY BAY.</a><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621"></a></div>

<p>Back of the concealing peninsula the bay
of Monterey sweeps in a great crescent to
Santa Cruz, thirty miles away, and to exploring
navigators, shunning possible shoals,
the coast presented a seemingly unbroken
line. It came to be the scientific belief that
some geologic upheaval had altered the
contour of the coast. Mariners were mystified.
Efforts to rediscover Monterey assumed
the nature of crusades. No less a personage
than Gaspar de Portala, with a retinue of
sixty-five persons, set out overland from Loreto
in 1769 to find the vanished harbor.
Without identifying the haven he sought, he
camped on its tree-rimmed beaches and erected
a cross under the ancient oak in whose shade
Vizcaino had partaken of the sacrament.</p>

<p>A year later came the seer and scholar
Junípero. Long before, in his college in Majorca
where he graced with distinction the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span>
chair of philosophy, he had read and treasured
the description Vizcaino had given. Now he
recognized the surviving oak and the neighboring
springs, and, turning, he saw unrolled
before him the bay which, in its vastness, had
to other eyes seemed only a part of the open
sea.</p>

<p>Inspecting Portala's wooden cross, Junípero
saw that at the base were votive offerings of
birds, shells, strings of fish newly caught, and
in a beaver-skin quiver a cluster of arrows
tipped with obsidian. Here were signs and
portents which to Junípero were ever a source
of inspiration. In after years he learned that
the Eslenes, or Monterey Indians, had for
ages handed down a tradition that some
day a messiah would come to them; and
that just before the advent of Junípero, the
cross which Portala had reared seemed to rise
in the sky at night until its splendor filled the
heavens; and that then the tribes, believing
their deliverer was at hand, came with gifts of
food and trinkets to this unaccustomed altar
and, in token of the peace they felt, tied a
quiver of arrows to the cross.</p>

<p>In the fertile valley of Carmel just over the
pine-clad cordillera that conceals the bay, on a<span class="pagenum">[624]</span>
slope above the thundering surf, Junípero
dedicated the Mission that was to be named
San Carlos in honor of the King. Hanging
his bells on a cypress branch, he chimed the
tidings of the gospel he was to preach.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_666.jpg"> SAN CARLOS CHURCH.</a><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624"></a></div>

<p>"Why sound this call?" protested his companions;
"there are no heathen here."</p>

<p>"Would that these bells might be heard
around the world!" replied Junípero.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span></p>

<p>Few events in Spanish history since the expulsion
of the Moors three centuries before
had occasioned the joy that greeted the news
of the rediscovery of Monterey. In the Mexican
capital cathedral bells pealed throughout
the night, rockets flared in the sky, and guns
in the forts kept up a cannonade. Later, in
Madrid the rejoicing was even more tumultuous.
Royal salutes were added to the
acclaim and the King declared a public holiday.
A sandalled monk, seeking neither gain
nor temporal glory, the leader of a handful
of Franciscan pioneers, had restored a fabled
harbor to the world.</p>

<p>The discovery of the bay of San Francisco,
reported at the same time, was ignored as a
trivial and miscellaneous item.</p>

<p>The celebration in honor of Junípero's
discovery gave new impetus to his plans of
Christian conquest, and Monterey was declared
the capital of the colonial empire.</p>

<p>For a time it appeared that nothing more
would be needed to stimulate Spain to hold
the western coast of America against the world.
But Castilian enthusiasm was short-lived.
The mystery of Monterey having been cleared
away and the event deliriously lauded, Spain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
lapsed into an indefinite programme concerning
the Californian coast. Both Madrid and Mexico
all but forgot Monterey and the activities
of wandering friars who, radiating thence, were
unconsciously preparing the way for a national
destiny as glorious as Spain's, even at the
height of her circumstance and pomp.</p>

<p>Now came the critical moment in Junípero's
career, a moment that was to decide the fate
of the western half of the New World. Antonio
Bucareli had been installed as Viceroy of
Mexico. A keen man of conventional wisdom,
it seemed to him to be a waste of public
money to divert a stream of gold to maintain
the far-away civilizing dreams of mendicants
centred at Carmel. He would close the harbor
of San Blas, then maintained to equip expeditions
to the Californian settlements, and
abandon the fruitless undertaking of trying to
populate bleak promontories swept by winds
that brought home no rich argosies. The enterprise
of his subjects should be devoted to
more lucrative pursuits.</p>

<p>Here was need and opportunity for a supreme
test of the resources that had made the
founder of Monterey the heroic figure of the
West. He saw, as did no other Spaniard of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span>
day, the splendid future awaiting the Pacific
coast. There was no time to halt between
two opinions. Already Captain Behring had
explored northwestern waters in the name of
Russia, and now the fur traders of that empire,
establishing their commercial posts at Unalaska,
were prepared to claim the coast as far
south as sea-otters run. Captain Cook and
Vancouver were about to sail to try to nail the
Union Jack on every headland from Sitka to
San Diego. Disguised under the standard of
Portugal, privateersmen of various nations
were hoisting full sail in the race for western
conquest, and Louis XVI. was planning to
equip François de Gallup, Count de la Pérouse,
to transplant the eagles of France to California
crags. The end of the Seven Years'
War, a decade before Bucareli's remarkable
decision, had led to a recarving of America
among European powers, and jealousy and
world-wide ambition now steered the sea in
search of new empire.</p>

<p>All this was not then apparent on the surface,
but the cowled monk in his Mission at
Carmel divined events. Worldly power and
possession by him were trampled underfoot.
In humility he had turned his back upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span>
emoluments of scholarship to labor among savages
in the remote wilderness. The fame he
had achieved by the rediscovery of Monterey
was not of his choosing. Although he counted
all earthly things as dross he knew the action
of Bucareli meant the downfall of his
spiritual kingdom. In the flutter of foreign
sails he read a menace to Spain's sovereignty
on the coast. And so it happened that
in the same year that Patrick Henry, Thomas
Jefferson, and Dabney Carr in the Raleigh
tavern were pleading the cause that was to
wrest the Atlantic colonies from George III.,
an aged cripple in coarse robe of gray serge,
tied at the waist with a girdle of hemp, employed
his splendid eloquence in the viceregal
palace of the Mexican capital to save the
Pacific coast from the hands of navigators who
with roving commissions of conquest from
European kings and emperors were cruising in
the wake of Spanish indecision.</p>

<p>Here, again, Monterey was playing an all-important
part in history, for it was the fame
Junípero had won through its rediscovery that
sped his message to the Viceroy and through
him to the King. The humble monk had
made the long journey from Monterey with no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
other escort save an Indian acolyte, and
though lame, infirm, and of lowly mien, was
received with the consideration due an accredited
ambassador.</p>

<p>Bucareli was not only won over to maintain
the Californian settlements, but was fired to
achieve new conquests along the upper coast.
Junípero's memorial, forwarded to Madrid, reawakened
the sentiments his rediscovery of
Monterey had stirred. By the King's order
every recommendation of the pioneer friar was
adopted, offices for California were created at
permanent salaries, the treasury at Guadalajara
was pledged to the colonization of the
Pacific coast and Monterey named as the
abiding capital.</p>

<p>Thus an open highway to the sea was
unconsciously reserved for the United States.
Russia was forced up against the Arctic Circle,
England did not gain a foothold south of the
island Vancouver named, the privateers tacked
toward the South Seas, and when the French
explorer, Count de la Pérouse, sailed into the
harbor of Monterey the only thing he could
do to save his name from engulfing obscurity
was to introduce potatoes to a smiling land.
The following season, instead of the fleur-delis,<span class="pagenum">[630]</span>
potato blossoms in the flowering Carmel
were the only token that the King of France
had ever had designs upon the coast.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_672.jpg"> OLD MEXICAN JAIL.</a><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630"></a></div>

<p>The relief the Viceroy sent to Monterey in
response to Junípero's plea came none too
soon. For thirty-seven days the latter's boyhood
friend and lifelong <ins class="corr" title='Correction: Text was "colaborer"'>collaborator</ins>, Palou,
and his comrades at Carmel had gone without
a tortilla or a crumb of bread, subsisting patiently
on a little meal ground from peas.
But now began the years of mission prosperity
and peace, and thereafter in Monterey was
presented in miniature the story of the glory
and decline of Spain.</p>

<p>For half a century it was the brilliant capital
of Spain's new empire. It was a thriving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span>
metropolis and the gay seat of the Spanish
Court fifty years before the settlement at San
Francisco became more than a straggling
pueblo, struggling to survive against wind
and sand. In fact, for two generations after
the founding of Monterey San Francisco's
chief claim to distinction was that the first
craft to pass through the pillared channel that
leads to its incomparable harbor was a launch
hewn from a redwood felled by Ayala on the
banks of the Carmel.</p>

<p>Year after year in Monterey were great fêtes,
the laughter of beautifully gowned women,
the melody of troubadours, the click of castanets,
the trampling of horsemen in gay attire,
the triumphs of governors and captains,
and the booming of guns in the walled
presidio. Here at this capital titled officials
sat at the receipt of customs; here galleons
from Manila put in for repairs and departed
with cargoes of furs, and hither came fragatas
and paquebotes from the Mexican coast and
imposing craft from the four corners of the
earth. Over picturesque adobe consulates in
Monterey floated the flags of foreign nations
when the only standard reared in San Francisco
was a desolate wooden cross in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[632]</a></span>
Mission Dolores. And the road through the
mountain pines to Junípero's spiritual capital,
his cabecera, three miles away, over which governors
followed by glittering retinues marched
to solemnize their oaths of office and whither
they were borne for sepulture, was worn to its
primal rocks long before the path from the
San Francisco Mission to the bay became
more than a shifting trail.</p>

<p>San Francisco now can stand these invidious
comparisons, for when glory finally sailed
through the Golden Gate, fame departed from
Monterey.</p>

<p>The genius of Junípero gave to Monterey
an impetus that long survived his death. As
unconscious trustee, Spain, centring power at
Monterey, was holding the coast for the larger
destiny to follow.</p>

<p>The shadow of new events crept toward
Portala's cross. In a winter month in the
third decade of the nineteenth century an
unprecedented happening awakened the fears
of the Franciscans at Carmel,&mdash;the holy water
in the baptismal font in the San Carlos Mission
was found to be frozen. This unparalleled
thing in that bland clime could not, they
believed, but portend some unhappy fate. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[633]</a></span>
confirmation of their worst fears came the
news that the Viceroy had repudiated allegiance
to the King. The eagle of Mexico had
soared above the lion of Castile, and a rebel
had supplanted the King in the litany of
prayers. The conerstone of the mission
system had been broken; the crumbling process
was at hand.</p>

<p>Then came Fernandez, the Canónigo, the
most exalted ecclesiastical dignitary that had
ever set foot in Monterey. Junípero was a
Puritan of humble and contrite virtue. The
Canónigo was a swaggering roysterer, pledging
the revenues of the Church in games of
chance. On the occasions of Junípero's
journeyings from his capital, the tears of his
neophytes, the sound of mission bells, and the
prayers of his comrades attested the reverence
he had won. Races, revels, and bull-fights in
Monterey celebrated the convivial departure
of Fernandez.</p>

<p>A new era was at hand. Under the unstable
Mexican <i>régime</i>, chaos followed confusion.
In the twenty-four years that intervened
before the Stars and Stripes, hoisted over
Monterey, proclaimed the advent of the golden
age in the West, that city saw thirteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>
governors come and go. Communication with
Mexico was difficult. A governor at Monterey
when he rose in the morning did not know
whether to salute the flag of a liberator, an
emperor, a rebel, a president, or a king. Monterey,
too, had turmoils and revolutions of
her own. Ambitious intrigue placarded her
adobe walls with flaming ultimatos. The alcalde
and regidores of one day were prisoners
in irons the next. Anarchy to-day sat gravely
in the Ayuntamiento to-morrow, and governors
turned fugitive as usurpers assumed control.</p>

<p>Yet these Monterey revolutions were anæmic,
attended with less shedding of blood than
the bull-fights that celebrated the triumphs
of her voluble warriors. It was the opera-bouffe
warfare of little statesmen making their
clamoring exit from the stage of history.</p>

<p>The spectacular caballero in his jacket
laced with gold was passing away with the
phantoms he had chased. The Mission bells
grew silent. New horsemen thronged over
the mountain roads. New sailors cast anchor
in the harbor. A new flag floated over the
presidio, a flag that was not to be pulled down.
The American Republic had reached the
western sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span></p>

<p>Of these later events the guide informs
you with some fidelity to the facts as you
start on the famous Twenty-Mile Drive. He
tells you how the brig <i>Natalia</i>, upon which
Napoleon escaped from Elba, was wrecked by
storms in Monterey Bay in 1834 to typify
that Europe's power over California was gone
forever, and he will sell you fragments of the
wreck; he will tell you how Commodore
Jones in 1842, by mistake but in prophecy of
things to come, hoisted the American ensign
over Monterey; how in 1846, that flag, in the
hands of Commodore Sloat, went up to stay;
how in the following month the first newspaper
published on the Pacific coast made its
appearance in Monterey; in the corners of the
public squares he will show you the cannon
of John C. Frémont, and he will point you to
the Gabilan Mountains where on their highest
peak overlooking Monterey the famed "pathfinder"
unfurled the colors of his country and
bade defiance to the Mexicans, even before
he knew that war raged between the two
republics. Then your proud historian will show
you the ancient adobe capitol where in 1849,
just one hundred years from the time Junípero
set sail from Majorca, the first convention met<span class="pagenum">[636]</span>
to form the commonwealth of California,&mdash;a
convention which, though composed in the
major part of adventurers, some of whom
looked upon murder as a pastime, sent to
Washington the unanimous declaration that
slavery should never stain the Golden West,
and thus revived the great conflict in the
Senate and caused the famous compromise.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_678.jpg"> FISHING VILLAGE.</a><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636"></a></div>

<p>Then your pilot will guide you to the fishing
villages whence Spanish pescadores once put
out in their shallops to harvest the bay for
the governor and his Court. Later came the<span class="pagenum">[637]</span>
American whalers before the tide of commerce
turned the sperm whale and the finback to remoter
waters. Occasionally yet comes a sulphurbottom
following the tides of the Kuro
Sirva, and then there is vast excitement in
Pescadero Bay.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_679.jpg"> ANCIENT CYPRESS AT CYPRESS POINT.</a><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637"></a></div>

<p>Now through the groves of giant pines at
the edge of the sea where the western Chautauqua
meets, and then to Cypress Point, whose
trees, the guide informs you loftily, are identical
with the cedars of Lebanon, and you are
nearing the resting-place of Junípero.<span class="pagenum">[638]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_680.jpg"> STATUE OF JUNIPERO SERRA.</a><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638"></a></div>

<p>With the adjournment of the convention
that met at Monterey in response to the proclamation
of the military governor to frame a
State, the capital passed from that historic
town, and for many years the grave of its
founder was forgotten. The rush to the gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>
mines trod underfoot the old-time glories of
Monterey. From a throbbing capital it became
for a while a deserted village. Lichens grew in
its streets and the roofs of its houses crumbled.</p>

<p>As for the Mission at Carmel, rust muffled
its chimes; Spanish moss covered its tumbling
pilasters; its sanctuary was choked with wild
mustard; storms blew through the fallen
roof. The lizard alone kept watch of the ruin.</p>

<p>But when the new civilization had built its
cities and established its railways and there
was time again to cultivate the arts of rest,
romance turned once more to Monterey. Capital
saw in its ruins an opportunity for gain.
In its environs Stevenson beheld a paradise for
poets, and Monterey became a field of dalliance,
a mecca for millionaires at play, an unfailing
inspiration to every spirit in a mood to dream.</p>

<p>Junípero at Monterey initiated the activities
that held the coast against envious nations,
and now to his tomb comes the tide of travel.
A few years ago Mrs. Leland Stanford, representing
patriotic citizens and students whom
the eloquent writings of the historian Hittell
had inspired to veneration of Junípero,
restored the ruined Mission, so that now his
tomb is marked by no traces of neglect, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span>
there with the Carmel surf chanting his eternal
requiem, side by side with the comrades he
loved and the governors he and his followers
installed, this unconquerable friar who trudged,
lamely, ten thousand miles in the name of
God, establishing the outposts of Christianity
and opening the way for the Democracy
to come, is receiving the tardy homage his
genius and character deserve.</p>

<p>He was indeed one of Emerson's men who
"pin continents together."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_683.jpg"> OLD MEXICAN CUSTOM-HOUSE.</a><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641"></a></div>

<p>Now you climb to the crest of the cordillera.
Before you is the circling bay with its
border of white beaches. Beyond, Frémont's
Peak, the tall sentinel that first proclaimed
the advent of the dominant American. At
your feet the quaint capital that Junípero
founded, half adobe, half modern. You can
distinguish the time-tumbled walls that tell of
Spain's departed glory, and you see the crumbling
Cuartel and Custom-House of the Mexicans,
who lacked the Spaniards' Moorish taste
in their homes and public buildings. The old
capital has outlived its day. It thrives now
on trinkets and abelone shells, painted with
memories of the past. But on your left, set
in the midst of five hundred acres of flowers
and oaks and pines, are luxurious touches of<span class="pagenum">[642]</span>
modern life where business comes to forget
its cares, and romance spends its honeymoon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_684.jpg"> ANCIENT ADOBE CABIN, MONTEREY.</a><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642"></a></div>

<p>Descend the slope toward the city, passing
on your way ruined adobe cabins. Rounding
a turn in the historic road you see the smoke
of an incoming steamer bringing holiday passengers
through waters where, aforetime, Spanish
corvettes lurked for wily smugglers. From
the Cuartel as you near the old capital you
hear, instead of the war ballads of quixotic
guerreros, the merriment of school-children at
play. On the streets, instead of the alférez<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[643]</a></span>
coming on caparisoned horse to announce the
presence in the harbor of a stranger craft, you
encounter hotel-runners clattering in 'buses to
the pier. On surviving fragments of villa walls
you discern no solemn reglamentos. Advertisements
of swimming suits and fishing tackle
have supplanted the rhetorical decrees of the
Spanish governors. The descendants of the
naked Indians that crowded round the royal
carriage of Doña Eulalia of Catalonia a century
ago, shocking that titled lady to throw them
some of her purple and fine linen, now shamble
by you in slattern calico and jeans, bearing
bundles of laundry to a neighboring lagoon.
The cleansing process of their trade has for
them no personal contagion. In curio shops
that crowd the site of the old presidio where
the soldiers of Charles III. performed their
part in the programme of civilization Junípero
had outlined, you buy your souvenirs.</p>

<p>Then climb to Vizcanio's oak. Beyond the
cross reared here are the tottering memorials
in the ancient graveyard. A century of
strange and stirring romance is buried there.
From this weed-grown cemetery haunted by
memories which your guide cannot recall, you
again see the town and harbor in panorama, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span>
you get clearer glimpses of the paradise into
which landscape-gardeners have transformed
surrounding acres of sand-dunes over which
pobladores once ranged seeking pasturage for
their herds.</p>

<p>At your feet, along a well-kept road of
pounded shells, and across bridges framed of
the skeletons of whales buttressed with moss-grown
rocks, roll automobiles and victorias in
the pursuit of pleasure. Follow them blithely,
if you will, waving your hand to the past; or,
in the true spirit of historic pilgrimage, kneel
in this place of burial and spell the imperfectly
chiselled story of the Spanish pioneers
who, despite their visionary dreams, held, for
the government Washington was founding, a
highway to the Pacific.</p>

<h2>LOS ANGELES<br />

THE CITY OF THE ANGELS</h2>

<p class="chapby">By FLORENCE E. WINSLOW</p>


<p class="noin"><span class="firstq">"</span><span class="first">V</span>ERY near the terrestrial paradise," said
the old Spanish explorer of the sunlit
country, where stood in a later century the
pueblo of Los Angeles. Very near the terrestrial
paradise has it seemed to weary
travellers, hopeful invalids, and delighted
home-makers, who have from year to year wandered
across the desert to find rest, health, and
comfort in a climate where the terms winter
and summer are misnomers, where snows are
seen only on the mountain-tops above the
flowering plain, where severe heats are unknown,
and where Nature rewards those who
seek her gifts in largest measure. Climate
and situation are the environing elements
which count for most in the development
of the history of Los Angeles. These are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
responsible both for the easy, courteous, pleasure-loving
lives of the Spanish rancheros, and
the strenuous, vivid, progressive, municipal
experiences of the Americans in this modern
"pleasure city."</p>

<p>Los Angeles treasures the memory of ancient
Spanish days of daring and romance,
among which lie the beginnings of its civil life.
All that is left of the old Pueblo de Nuestra
Señora la Reina de los Angeles may be seen
now clustered about the old plaza, with its
church, in what is known as Sonora town.
Here the sun-baked adobe walls of the houses
nestle, with their Mexican residents, in the
midst of the bustling city, awaiting the final
decay which marks the passing of the Pueblo.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_689.jpg"> BELLS OF SAN GABRIEL.</a><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647"></a></div>

<p>Precedent to later social conditions of ease,
the careful student will find in the lives of the
earlier settlers of Alta California a strong,
vital, self-sacrificing religious impulse, which,
upon Pacific as upon Atlantic shores, induced
the initial movement in a civilization which
moved to its attempted end indifferent to
climate or environment, and using the material
only to subserve the interests of the dominant
spiritual. Junípero Serra, with his mission settlers
of 1769, was in subtlest ways akin to the
Pilgrim Fathers of the preceding century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span>
As Los Angeles was but a humble dependent
on San Gabriel Mission, its beginnings may
best be traced in connection with the history
of the mission fathers, the earliest colonizers
and civilizers of the sunset land. Their unstinted
and self-sacrificing devotion to the
Indians of California, their great mission
trade-schools, where not only the salvation of
souls but the training of the minds and hands
of the neophytes was undertaken, their wise
administration of their trusts, both spiritual
and material, make this initial movement in
the colonization of California one of the
brightest incidents in the story of the Golden
West.</p>

<p>Out of the mists of romance which envelop
the earlier explorers of the Pacific Coasts
appear the forms of Cabrillo and Vizcaino, the
first historic visitors to Southern California.</p>

<p>It may be that Francisco de Ulloa had in
1539 gained from the Pacific a glimpse of the
land, or that Hernando de Alarçon from
the Gila country saw the plain of Los Angeles
in 1540. Sure it is that Cabrillo in 1542, and
Vizcaino in 1603 visited San Diego and San
Pedro, the port of Los Angeles. The latter<span class="pagenum">[649]</span>
landed at San Diego, seeking a suitable port
for ships engaged in trade with the Philippines,
dug wells, and erected a church tent
for three friars who were of the party, and
then for 166 years this "fair land without
snow" drops out of history. It is left to its
Indian residents, left treasuring its resources
for future generations, for new peoples.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_691.jpg"> SAN DIEGO MISSION. FOUNDED 1769.</a><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649"></a></div>

<p>In 1769 came Junípero Serra&mdash;saint, hero,
and Franciscan father. In him the romance
of missionary enterprise finds embodiment;
with him and his missions the colonization of
Alta California began. The missions in the
peninsula of Lower California were, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span>
expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767, left in charge
of the Franciscans, and Serra's burning zeal
for the conversion of the Indians led him to
urge the prosecution of a long-cherished plan
of the Government. This was to provide the
Manila ships with good ports on the northwest
coasts and to promote settlements there.
There was a union of spiritual and physical
forces&mdash;soldiers under the military government
of Portolá co-operating with the missionaries
under Serra. Four expeditions, two proceeding
by sea and two by land, were reunited
at San Diego, where, on July 16th, the noble
missionary dedicated the first mission in Alta
California. It was but two years later that the
Mission San Gabriel Arcangel was founded,
with solemn chants of Veni, Creator Spiritus
and Te Deum Laudamus, and in the presence
of many Indians. Serra, who had entered in
a litter the land of promise where his zeal
and courage were to accomplish so much,
had already traveled toward San Francisco,
crossing mountain and desert on foot, and
establishing the Mission of San Carlos. The
missions were firmly organized and devoutly
conducted, and there were eighteen of them
by the end of the century. Forty padres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span>
had gathered in these first industrial training-schools
a population of 13,500 converted
Indian neophytes, to whom they had taught
the arts of civilization.</p>

<p>San Gabriel became one of the richest
missions. Its church has never been disused;
to-day it welcomes strangers as in the
time when it received those weary pilgrims,
the founders of Los Angeles, who came from
Loreto across the deserts of Colorado, on the
route first taken by Anza through the San
Gorgonio pass, and were provided by the
hospitable fathers with all that was needed
for rest and refreshment. The centre of the
civilized and agricultural life of the district,
San Gabriel, was a great material as well as
spiritual force. It had its guard of ten soldiers
and its three padres. Two of these,
Cruzado and Sanchez, ministered side by side
to the California Indians for thirty years, and
the latter had a missionary experience of
fifty-five years.</p>

<p>The name of Los Angeles is first found in
the Mission report of 1773. It is given to the
river first named Porzinucula discovered by
Portolá's expedition of 1769. This discovery,
as recorded by Padre Crespi, was made upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[652]</a></span>
the anniversary of the feast of our Lady of
Angels. The Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la
Reina de los Angeles was founded in 1781.
Till then there had been in the new country
only missions and presidios, the military stations;
but the settlement of colonies in pueblos
was part of the original Spanish plan, and the
necessity of obtaining additional supplies for
the use of the presidios gave the needed
stimulus.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_695.jpg"> THE PUEBLO OF LOS ANGELES. EARLY SPANISH PLAN.
SUERTES FROM C TO E.</a><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653"></a></div>

<p>Under instructions issued by Governor
Néve a site for a dam was first selected, water
being then as now a primary essential. The
pueblo was placed on high land near these
facilities for irrigation, a plaza of two hundred
by three hundred varas being laid out, with
corners facing the cardinal points, so that
three streets should run perpendicularly from
each of its four sides, that no street might be
swept by the winds. Yet tradition saith that
Los Angeles winds have not kept always to
the cardinal points. Solares, or house-lots, of
twenty by forty varas were given to settlers in
numbers equal to the available suertes, field-lots.
Two suertes of dry, and two of irrigable
land, were given to each family. One fourth
of the suertes were left vacant, as realangas or<span class="pagenum">[653]</span>
government lands, while a number, called propios,
were reserved for municipal expenses.
Colonists received ten dollars a month each,
for two years; also regular rations, seeds,
clothing, and live stock. Twelve men with
their families, including eleven women and
twenty-six children, were the colonizers of Los
Angeles. They were principally Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span>
soldiers. On September 14, 1781, the plaza
of the new town was solemnly dedicated by
the mission priests, who came in procession
from San Gabriel, attended by Indian neophytes
and a guard of soldiers. To the twelve
settlers, twelve building-lots were given.
These were laid out on three sides of the
plaza, while the fourth was reserved for a
church and public buildings. In 1786 the
Governor sent José Arguello to formally renew
the leases of houses, lots, and branding-irons.
At this time not one settler could sign
his name. A small church was erected in
1784. It was but twenty-three by fifty feet in
size, and was served by the padres of San
Gabriel. One of these, Padre Oumetz, was
for thirty years a companion of Serra in his
missionary labors. He died at San Gabriel in
1811. It was at least twenty years before Los
Angeles ceased to be dependent on San
Gabriel and to develop a small trade of its
own. Outside the pueblo provisional grants
of ranchos were soon made. The largest and
best of all of these was known later as Los
Nietos, and was given to the heirs of Manuel
Nito by Figueroa, who divided it into tracts
in 1834. The Dominguez rancho, given by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span>
Fages to Don José Dominguez, was regranted
by Sola in 1822 to Sergeant Christobal Dominguez.
La Zanja, the home of the Verdugos,
the Encino and the Simi ranchos, Las Virgines,
El Conejo
Santa Ana, the
Bartolo Tapia
and Antonio
Maria ranchos,
were the homes
of such families
as the Picos and
Ortegas, whose
wealth and
power contributed
to the future
glory of
the pueblo near
which they
lived, while the
Félix ranch
was actually
within the pueblo bounds.</p>

</div>

<p>Settled largely by soldiers, Los Angeles
came under military government and was slow
to develop self-governing local principles.
It was ruled by commissionados, of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span>
Félix was the first, and by alcaldes. But local
jurisdiction was limited, and cases went
beyond the towns to be decided by military
garrisons a hundred miles away. By 1810 the
population was 365 and the crops in the fertile,
well-watered plain amazingly large. By 1820
the ninety-one pobladores now occupying the
town site were able to supply much produce
to the presidios, while 56,600 vines were flourishing
in the vineyards about San Gabriel.</p>

<p>In 1814 Padre Gil Taboada laid the corner-stone
of a new church, but the site was
changed and there was difficulty in raising the
necessary funds; so the building was not completed
until 1822. The builders were Indian
neophytes, who were paid at the rate of one
real (12-1/2 cts.) a day. The citizens contributed
five hundred cattle, and the missions
subscribed seven barrels of brandy, worth
$575, wine, cattle, and mules. A new government
building was added, and both this
and the church were surrounded by houses
of the aristocracy. Ignacio Coronel was one
who at this time petitioned for a house-lot
near the "new" church. The first resident
priest, Fray <ins class="corr" title='Correction: Text was "Geromino"'>Geronimo</ins> Boscana, took possession
of his parish house in a town of six
hundred souls. The church was enlarged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span>
1841, and reroofed in 1861. Education in Los
Angeles began with a village school taught
by Maxima Piña, who began his labors in 1790,
receiving a salary of $140 a year. Coronel was
a later teacher.</p>

WITH SPANISH CANNON BROUGHT TO SAN DIEGO BY SERRA IN 1769.</a><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657"></a></div>

<p>In 1822 California became a province of
the Mexican Empire, the military office was
abolished, the alcaldes were retained, a secretary
and treasurer were added, and an elective
body, the Ayuntamiento, was established.
Thus the government of Los Angeles went
on about as it had gone under the rule of
Spain. The Ayuntamiento was elected <ins class="corr" title='Correction: Text was "anually"'>annually</ins>
until 1839, and proved a most versatile
body, constantly changing its political attitudes
during the controversies of later years.</p>

<p>The mission fathers made little objection
to this change of government, but when, in
1824, Mexico became a republic and Alta
California its territory, they opposed themselves
to the ruling powers. From this time
on the Mexican Government pressed its plans
of secularization until, in 1834, the ruin of the
missions was complete, and that of the gentle
Indians, whose rights they had hitherto
guarded, was begun.<span class="pagenum">[659]</span></p>

<p>Durant Cilly, a visitor to Los Angeles in
1827, found a "city of gardens," and in 1830,
a prosperous year of large crops, there were
one thousand inhabitants who, by vessels landing
at the port of San Pedro, engaged in a
large trade in hides and tallow.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_701.jpg"> THE OLD PLAZA CHURCH, LOS ANGELES.</a><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659"></a></div>

<p>In 1818 the first American arrived in Los<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span>
Angeles. He was followed by a succession
of trappers and hunters. There was Captain
Paty who, with a party of Kentucky trappers,
visited the town and was baptized into the
Catholic faith at San Diego, Don Pico acting
as sponsor. Pryor's party settled in the
pueblo, and built houses and planted vineyards.
Next came sailors of the brig <i>Danube</i>,
which went ashore off San Pedro on Christmas
Eve, 1828. These were all hospitably welcomed
in Los Angeles. Samuel Prentice of
Connecticut came, and John Gronigen, the
first German settler, planted his vineyard
on the ground afterwards occupied by the
Domingo block. A trade with Santa Fé
sprang up, and Wolfskill, who came with a
party of trappers in 1830, brought Mojave
blankets, exchanging them for mules. In
1832-33 more Americans came from New
Mexico. There were Paulding, Carpenter and
Chard, Moses Carson, and later Benjamin
Hayes, who was for eleven years district judge
of Los Angeles, and, after 1847, more trappers
and many sailors, who were willing to remain
and plough land. Last of all came the American
merchant, farmer, and speculator. By
1836, there were in Los Angeles forty-six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span>
foreigners, of whom twenty-one were Americans;
also 553 Indians, the remaining 2228
inhabitants of the district being Mexicans
and Spaniards, the latter of pure Castilian
blood, with a generous and wise pride in a
high descent, the aristocrats of the coast.</p>

<p>Slight attempts at ship-building were made
at San Pedro in 1831, Padre Sanchez of San
Gabriel aiding Wolfskill, Pryor, Prentice,
Fount, and Loughlin to build a schooner. In
1833, when Antonio Osio had charge of the
port trade, Los Angeles shipped one hundred
thousand hides and twenty-five thousand centals
of tallow, but the trade slackened after
the secularization in 1834. The cattle of San
Gabriel were all slaughtered, and by 1840 the
mission live stock had disappeared. Padre
Estenéga in 1845 gave up the mission estates
to the Government.</p>

<p>A strenuous and important period in the
history of the town followed. From 1831 to
1840 the Angelenos held themselves largely
responsible for the salvation of California, as
they understood it; and Los Angeles became
the centre of political agitation. The South
was divided against the North, and often
against itself, and many typical California<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[662]</a></span>
battles, terrific in bluster and intent, but bloodless
in reality, occurred near the old pueblo.</p>

<p>It was during the banishment of José Carrillo,
with whom Vincente Sanchez, alcalde of
Los Angeles, had quarrelled, that the trouble
with Victoria, the Mexican Governor, came.
Sanchez had been deposed by the Ayuntamiento,
but was reinstated as alcalde by
Victoria, who at the same time ordered the
imprisonment of eight prominent citizens. An
insurgent army defeated Victoria in a fight
near Los Angeles, and the Governor, deserted
by his army, surrendered to Echeandia December
4, 1831, and was allowed to depart
the country. Sanchez was put in irons. One
hundred citizens took part in this battle.</p>

<p>Los Angeles was made not only a city but
the capital in 1835, and soon became the storm-centre
of the country. There may have been
lack of zeal in providing necessary public
buildings for the Government, but there was
none at all in furnishing abundantly that
quality of fiery zeal essential to Mexican
revolutions. Governor Carrillo made the town
his residence in 1838. Alvarado succeeded
him when the plots and counterplots of the
disputacions had sent Carrillo to the North.<span class="pagenum">[663]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_705.jpg"> A TYPICAL COTTAGE</a><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663"></a></div>

<p>José Figueroa made an able governor, but
he died in 1835, and a period of conflict, during
which Los Angeles, as the capital of the
South, was arrayed against the North, followed.
Alvarado, who had declared California
a sovereign state, entered the town in 1837
and subdued the Mexican sympathizers. Two
years later Alvarado divided Alta California
into two districts, making Los Angeles the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span>
capital of the South, with Santiago Arguello
as prefect.</p>

<p>Great efforts were at this time made to
beautify the city, and there were gay scenes in
these days in the old pueblo. The owners of
the great ranches entertained largely, visiting
from house to house, dressing gayly, and engaging
in all sorts of equestrian sports. The
men lived in their saddles; the women were
the gayest and sweetest of hostesses, while
they were yet domestic, and brought up large
families easily in the free, open-air life which
the conditions of fine climate and rich soil
made possible. When Micheltorena in 1842
made his capital in Los Angeles, the gayeties
reached their height; he was received with
enthusiasm by the Ayuntamiento; there were
speeches, salutes, and illuminations; balls and
sports alternated with juntas and revolutions.
Yet Los Angeles was glad to be rid of Micheltorena
when he removed to Monterey, and its
citizens were foremost in a revolt against him
in 1845, and fought him without the city in a
battle where there was much cannonading and
no bloodshed. Pio Pico was head of the
Commission which met in Los Angeles and
banished Micheltorena.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span></p>

<p>The city remained the capital of the department
of the South, and Pio Pico was
Governor while José Castro acted as General.
Castro again went to the North and soon
joined Carrillo against Pico in a new quarrel
of North and South.</p>

<p>It was in 1846, when California was rent
with the controversy between Castro, representing
the military, and Pico, the civil power,
and the March Assembly was in session at Los
Angeles, that the approach of the forces of the
United States, under Stockton and Frémont,
forced the contending commanders to unite at
Los Angeles in opposition to a common foe.</p>

<p>Abel Stearns, the confidential agent of the
United States in the South, owned a warehouse
in San Pedro. John Forster was made,
in 1843, captain of the port; in 1845 Commodore
Jones landed here to make his apologies
to Micheltorena for his premature raising of
the Stars and Stripes at Monterey. Here
Micheltorena embarked for exile; and here, in
1846, Commodore Stockton disembarked with
his sailors for the capture of Los Angeles,
having already raised the American flag at
Monterey. Refusing all the attempts at conciliation
offered by Pico and Castro, Stockton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span>
united his forces with those of the California
battalion under Frémont, who had landed at
San Diego, entered Los Angeles, and raised
the American flag at 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> of August 13, 1846.</p>

<p>Pico and Castro had left the city to escape
the dishonor of
surrender, and
the frightened
inhabitants had
fled to the neighboring
ranchos,
but returned to
their homes before
night, attracted
by the irresistible
strains
of a brass band,
and assured that
they would be
left unharmed.</p>

<img src="images/illo_708.jpg" width="200" alt="" title="" /><br />
<span class="caption">JOHN C. FRÉMONT.</span>
</div>

<p>Stockton ordered the election of new
alcaldes, and appointed Frémont military
commander of the district. When both commanders
returned to the North, Gillespie,
with a garrison of fifty men, was left in charge
of Los Angeles. He seems to have interfered
with the amusements of the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[667]</a></span>
and to have made himself needlessly unpopular.
A revolt was organized, and Flores,
one of Castro's generals, appeared, with three
hundred men at his back, and summoned the
garrison to surrender. This Gillespie did,
after bravely holding Fort Hill for a time.
The Americans took ship from San Pedro on
October 4th.</p>

<p>The reconquest of Los Angeles took place
on January 18th. General Kearny, with Kit
Carson as guide, had succeeded in joining
Stockton at San Diego, and the united forces,
after a two-hours' engagement at San Gabriel
and another brief skirmish without the city,
entered Los Angeles, while the leaders of the
revolt fled to Cahuenga, and surrendered to
Frémont, who made generous terms of capitulation
with Andres Pico, Flores, and Manuel.
This clemency endeared him to the Californians.
It became his boast that he could
ride unharmed alone from one end of the
conquered country to the other. Stockton
made him Governor of Los Angeles while the
controversy between Kearny and Stockton, as
to which was the chief authority in the conduct
of affairs in the new country, was in progress.
Frémont chose to obey Stockton, with whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span>
he had worked in unison during the Northern
conquests and before the arrival of Kearny.
Kearny was technically in the right in demanding
the submission of Frémont, as the
court-martial of the latter (in Washington, at
a later day) made evident; but under the
circumstances of the quarrel of the two leaders
at Los Angeles, Frémont's allegiance to Stockton
seems to have been his only manly course.</p>

<p>This was an era in which Los Angeles grew
from an easy-going Spanish pueblo into a
progressive American city. Nowhere have
Americans stood more completely in the
position of conquerors in a new land. Called
upon to improvise hastily a government for a
large body of strangers, these citizens showed,
together with carelessness and over-hastiness&mdash;and
an indifference to the rights of strangers,
both Indians and Spaniards, of which we cannot
be proud&mdash;some of our best national traits.
From the first, the pioneers were courageous
and teachable, and succeeded, after many
mistakes, in building up a permanent, well-organized,
and progressive municipality. General
Frémont was undoubtedly most popular
among the Spanish people. His youth enabled
him to enter in a large degree into their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[669]</a></span>
sports; his clemency in pardoning Flores and
the other generals of the rebellion won their
applause.</p>

<p>It was from his gubernatorial residence,
the old two-story adobe at the corner of Aliso
and Los Angeles Streets, that Frémont set
forth with Jesus Pico and Jacob Dodson for
his famous mustang ride to Monterey. The
feat, with its object&mdash;to defend his position as
Governor against Kearny&mdash;was such as to appeal
to the imagination of the people of Los
Angeles, both Mexican rancheros and American
trappers and sailors. Over desert and
mountain the three riders flew, leaving on the
morning of March 22d and reaching Monterey,
five hundred miles away, on the afternoon
of the fourth day. The return was
accomplished with equal speed, so that the
trip of one thousand miles was made in a little
over eight days. Frémont did great service
in the Senate of the United States, where he
pleaded for the land rights of Indian and
Spanish residents, and in later years, when
his influence aided in the exclusion of
slavery from the new State of California.
The town council was re-established in 1847,
Don José Salazar and Don Enrique Abila<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span>
being alcaldes; but in 1848 Governor Mason
dissolved the council and installed Stephen G.
Foster as alcalde. A semi-military rule was
kept up under Colonel Stevenson until May,
1849, when a new ayuntamiento was established.</p>

<p>The cattle trade was at its best from 1850
to 1860, when in one year one hundred thousand
hides at $15 apiece were shipped from
San Pedro, but the business was injured by
the drouth of 1863 and 1864. The town
grew slowly, increasing in orchards and vineyards,
its ranchos&mdash;many new ones having
been granted by Pico in 1846&mdash;sheltered in
the bend of the Los Angeles River, which, by
ancient decree, is, from the mountains down,
the property of the city. In 1851 Los Angeles
grapes brought in San Francisco 20 cts.
a pound; at the mines, $1. The city escaped
the excitement of the gold fever, although the
yellow metal was first discovered near Los
Angeles in 1835. Among the noted Spanish
families at the time of the conquest were the
Lugos, the Sepulvedas, the Bandinis, the Estudillos,
the Oliveros, the Picos, and the
Coronels. Prominent among the pioneers of
old Los Angeles were the Workmans, Temples,
and Wolfskills, David W. Alexander, Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[672]</a></span>
Couts, and Governor Downey, Judge J.R.
Scott and Benjamin D. Wilson, Robert S.
Baker and Hugo Reid. Hon. H.C. Foster,
one of the early mayors of Los Angeles, became
a resident of the city in 1847. Governor
Pio Pico, who had fled at the approach
of Stockton to save the "honor" of Mexico,
returned and became a conspicuous private
citizen. He lived to a great age, duly performing
his duty as a registered voter.</p>

<p>It was Don Antonio Coronel, dead but a
decade, who most picturesquely and honorably
represented to the new Los Angeles the
old régime. He was of "courtly presence,
ripe experience, high integrity, and great personal
fascination," and was to his latest days
"a quenchless patriot, white-haired, clear-eyed,
and supple," the life of any circle he
might be persuaded to adorn. His father,
Don Ignacio Coronel, came to the town with
the Hijar Colony. He was a man of note
and opened in 1839 a school&mdash;much needed,
if the fact be true that there were then in the
pueblo but fifty-four men who could read and
write. Antonio was in 1843 Visitador del Sud
under the Mexican, and in 1853 Mayor of Los
Angeles under the American, Government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[674]</a></span>
He was a warm friend of Helen Hunt Jackson,
who thoroughly identified herself with
the interests of the older peoples of Los
Angeles and its environs.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_715.jpg"> FIRST STAGE IN THE ASCENT OF MT. LOWE, CONNECTING WITH

<p>Up to 1852 the houses in Los Angeles were
of adobe,&mdash;the sun-baked brick of the country,&mdash;and
these were comfortable indeed, cool in
summer and warm in winter. It was in one of
these ample residences&mdash;that of Colonel J.G.
Nichols&mdash;that the Rev. J.W. Brier, of the M.
E. Church, held the first regular Protestant
service, and in another that the Rev. Dr.
Wicks, a Presbyterian, opened the first
English-speaking school. These events were in
1850, so that church and school were ready
to receive the first American child (Gregg
Nichols, who was born in April, 1851).</p>

<p>The corner of Third and Main Streets blossomed
into brick in 1852, in the new, proud,
one-story building, serving, in 1859, as the
home of Captain Winfield S. Hancock, who
was always exceedingly popular in Los Angeles.
He revisited the city a few years before
his death, and received an enthusiastic ovation.</p>

<p>In 1849 San Pedro had the first steamer,
the old <i>Gold Hunter</i>, and by 1859 the <i>Senator</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[675]</a></span>
made three monthly trips. There was now a
stage line to San Diego, and overland stages
left for the East three times a week. Frequent
freight trains passed between the city
and Salt Lake, but it was not until the coming
of the several railroads that Los Angeles attained
its phenomenal growth and became the
great city of the Southwest. Set richly between
the sparkling waves of the Pacific and
the jasper heights of the Sierra Madre Mountains,
Los Angeles now rests in its fertile
plains, a radiating jewel, its suburbs climbing
the bases of its hills, its roads ascending cañons,
its sparkling beaches curving sharply inward
from the sea. Its clustered cottages are surrounded
with trees and flowers, which bloom
throughout the year in inconceivable profusion.
Its streets are lined with graceful pepper
and eucalyptus trees, its palatial homes are
set amid tropic foliage, its hills are crowned
with public institutions. The southern portion
of the city is level, but on the north and
south are hills. Within the city limits, at a
level of three hundred feet above the sea, may

wonder that in twenty years the population
has grown from 11,000 to 103,000&mdash;increased
during the winter months by thousands of
tourists, who are brought easily to the gates
of this city of the sunset land. Its daring
trolleys mount the great hills from rose garden
to snowy height, its railroads, entering
from east and north, bear the charmed traveller
through sunny ranches of olive and walnut
tree, through great vineyards and orange orchards;
and to ships entering the harbor at
San Pedro are revealed the beauties of flower-swept
hills, which in their season flaunt their
fields of yellow poppy toward the sea.</p>

<p>The saddest event in the history of modern
Los Angeles was the land boom, which, after
first enriching and then ruining many inhabitants,
collapsed in 1889, leaving the town
prostrate. The rise in values was so rapid
that a corner lot costing in 1851 thirty dollars,
and worth in 1860 $300 a front foot, increased
by 1870 to $500 and by 1880 to $1,000 a front
foot. In 1889 its sale was pushed to $2,500.
Other lots worth in 1883 $20, brought in
1889 $800 a front foot. Lands outside the
town, worth up to 1868 $1 an acre, brought, in
1887, $1,000.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span></p>

<p>The effects of this over-expansion on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[678]</a></span>
young, vigorous, richly dowered community
were, however, but temporary; the city of the
Angels arose from temporary defeat to enter
at once upon an era of growth and prosperity
unexampled in the history of cities, and all
but magic in its extent.</p>

<p>A dozen lines of railroad centre in the city,
whose trade extends from Fresno on the
north to the easternmost limits of Arizona.
Eighteen years ago the city adopted a successful
scheme of electric lighting, and its
trolley system is one of the best in the United
States. For the last decade the building
trades have been rapidly growing. Building
permits to the value of $23,000,000 have been
issued, and in 1900 alone $2,700,000 was invested
in new buildings.</p>

<p>The city has 200 miles of paved streets,
330 miles of sidewalks, and 160 miles of sewers;
but its complete and perfect system of
irrigation is one of its greatest beauties. The
"Zanjero" has from its earliest years been an
important municipal functionary, and the flowing
of well-kept channels of fine water, in
sparkling zanjos along the sides of the principal
streets, adds to the beauty of roads and
grounds, while through a system of new and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span>
beautiful parks the visitor can obtain some of
the finest views in the world by simply driving
about the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_721.jpg"> STATE NORMAL SCHOOL.</a><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679"></a></div>

<p>If the traveller seek the suburbs he will
drive for mile after mile through groves of
orange and lemon, fig, peach, pear, and apricot
orchards; he will see on one side of the town
great sweeps of almond and walnut trees; on
another, ranches planted in vineyard and olive.
There are, perhaps, three million fruit trees
growing in the district, half of which are in
full bearing. The land bears, too, great crops
of alfalfa, which in fertile places is cut from
three to six times a year. Oranges, of course,
are the chief export; but there are, besides,
wine, brandy, wheat and barley, sugar-cane,
and all varieties of fresh vegetables. If the
tenderfoot hear that Los Angeles corn grows
sometimes to a height of twenty feet, that
pumpkins weighing four hundred pounds have
been raised, or even that holes from which
beets have been pulled are of a size sufficient
for fence-posts, he need not doubt. There
are three large beet-sugar factories, and in the
county $100,000 worth of olives, and more
than that of honey, are annually produced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681"></a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_723.jpg"> COURT-HOUSE, LOS ANGELES.</a></div>

<p>The population of the city is cosmopolitan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[682]</a></span>
as may be known from the fact that, in addition
to the exceptionally good English papers
of the city, organs in German, French, Spanish,
Italian, Basque, and Chinese are issued.
A large number of Chinese, several thousand,
are engaged in raising vegetables or in domestic
labor of the several kinds. As in all
California towns, they have a residence section
of their own, and are quiet, orderly, reliable,
and useful.</p>

<p>Los Angeles is a city of churches, and its
philanthropies are many; its educational advantages
are remarkably good. At the head
of a noticeably complete system of training
stands the University of Southern California,
which opened its doors in 1880, with Dr.
Bovard as President. Its College of Medicine
is a well-equipped institution, and its
progress is identified with the name of Dr.
J.P. Widney. An exceptionally fine normal
school completes the training given by the
public-school system, with its high schools
and fifty-five grammar schools, all housed in
buildings which might be the pride of any
community. The buildings which house its
free library system, its City Hall, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[683]</a></span>
County Court-House, are well conceived for
their several purposes, and architecturally of
great beauty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a href="images/illo_725.jpg"> IMPROVED HARBOR OF SAN PEDRO, PORT OF LOS ANGELES.</a></div>

<p>But Los Angeles is above all a city of
homes and of gardens. The mildness of the
climate permits the most delicate plants and
trees to flourish throughout the winter. Giant
bananas, fan and date-palms, rise above the
houses, and at Christmas are seen hedges of
callas, geraniums ten feet high, heliotropes
covering whole sides of houses, and such
wealth of roses and orange blossoms as baffles
description.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[684]</a></span></p>

<p>A feature of Los Angeles is its beautiful
sea beaches. Easily accessible by trolley and
by rail, Santa Monica, Redondo, Long Beach,
and San Pedro provide unsurpassed facilities
to the citizens, and the island of Santa
Catalina, twenty miles off the coast, is even
more attractive&mdash;a seashore resort where
bathing is a comfortable pastime every day
in the year, and where fishermen find delights
unending.</p>

<p>The construction of the Government breakwater
at San Pedro is a great commercial
enterprise and will be of certain benefit to
the city, which will thus gain a larger share
of the increasing trade with the Orient.
Three million dollars have been appropriated
for deepening the water over the bar, so that
large vessels may come to the wharf. Dry
docks and fortifications are to follow; and a
new railway, with its terminal at San Pedro,
will connect Los Angeles with Salt Lake
City, and open to trade a new and rich section
of country in southern Nevada and in
Utah.</p>

parallels forty-one and forty-two, and a line one hundred and twenty
miles west of the western line of Pennsylvania and parallel with it,
was "reserved" to Connecticut when she ceded to the United States
certain territory which she had received from the grant of Charles
II. Of this territory Connecticut granted one half million of acres
to such of her soldiers as had suffered from the British during the
Revolution. The larger, if not the entire, part of the balance
passed into the control of a private-public corporation, known as
the Connecticut Land Company.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Under treaty stipulations negro and Indian slaves were held
until Michigan became a State. Detroit has always had to do with
slavery questions. Before the Civil War it was an important station
on the "Underground Railroad," and occasionally slaves were seized
on our streets. Some of the conspicuous leaders of the party that
secured the abolition of slavery lived at one time or another in
Detroit. General Grant's home may still be seen. United States
Senator Zachariah Chandler of "blood-letting letter" fame was one
of our oldest merchants, and the notable "fire-in-the-rear" editorial
appeared in a local paper.</p></div>

English Fort erected in 1778 by
Major R.B. Lernoult as a defense
against the Americans. It was subsequently
called Fort Shelby, in honor
of Gov. Isaac Shelby of Kentucky,
and was demolished in 1826.
</p><p>
The evacuation of this Fort by the
British at 12 o'clock noon, July 11th,
1796, was the closing act of the War
of Independence.
</p><p>
On that day the American Flag was
for the first time raised over this
soil, all of what was then known
as the Western Territory becoming
at that time part of the Federal Union."

by George III. for £5000, was long in possession of Dr. John R.
Bailey, Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel U.S.V., and author of a most
interesting monograph on Mackinac. It is from its pages, and by
his kind permission, that the Indian signatures to the document
are here reproduced.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> For an admirable statement of the facts bearing upon this
interesting problem, the reader is asked to turn to <i>My Notebook of the
French Revolution</i>, by Mrs. Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer (A.C.
McClurg &amp; Co.). The book upon which Mrs. Latimer has chiefly
based her account, <i>The Lost Prince</i>, by the Rev. Mr. Hanson, has
long been out of print, and is almost inaccessible.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> La Salle, in drawing his maps, made the Ouabache to empty into
the Mississippi at Cairo, According to him the Oyo (Ohio) was
a tributary of the Ouabache. About 1702, one, M. Juchereau, sent
to establish a post for the protection of the traders in peltries,
reported that he had established a post about forty leagues above
the mouth of the Ouabache. Some writers have taken that to mean
Vincennes, and it is so recorded in some of the encyclopædias,
but his post was on what is now called the Ohio, and not on the
Wabash.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Clark began at once to organize an expedition against Detroit,
but it never started. Francis Vigo, who had let Clark have provisions
and money for his expedition against Vincennes, aided in like
manner in fitting out the new expedition, lending money to the
amount of $8616, for which Clark gave him an order on Virginia.
The order was never honored, and an appeal was made to Congress.
Finally, in 1872, nearly a century after the debt was contracted, and
nearly thirty-seven years after Vigo had died in extreme poverty,
Congress referred the matter to the Court of Claims, which four
years later allowed the claim, together with more than $41,000 in
interest.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Among the Sacs, "Checagau" was the name of one of their
valiant warriors and colonizers, and meant "He that stands by the
tree." Among the several tribes of the Algonquin group "Chekago,"
"Chicagong," etc., was pronounced in a variety of ways and
had as many meanings.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The Indian names now given to the lakes of this region are
modern appellations; originally they were numbered First, Second,
Third, and Fourth as they progressed towards the source&mdash;the
order in which they were encountered by the federal surveyors
in ascending the Catfish, a branch of Rock River, and the outlet
of the lakes. Their present names, adopted in 1856, are Kegonsa,
Waubesa, Monona, and Mendota, respectively.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The author has, of course, omitted to say what many of his readers
understand, that as secretary he has had a large share in giving
the Wisconsin Historical Society its conspicuous position in the
public mind.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The prediction was fulfilled the following year, when it became
necessary to construct elaborate works to save the waterpower.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> In this account the directions are misleading, as they thought
the river ran east and west instead of north and south at this point.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> See chapter on Salt Lake City.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Some secular officials, such as marshals and other peace officers,
had been chosen, but these were generally nominated by the Church
leaders and elected or "sustained" by vote of the people in Church
gatherings. The secular power exercised by the Church officials was
expressly delegated to them by vote of the people.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The reader will yet more vividly recall that <i>The Man with the
Hoe</i> came out of San Francisco and will heartily approve the editor's
selection of Mr. Markham to contribute this chapter to the volume.
